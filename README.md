Use the reddit scraper to create a dataset (You will need to create your own PRAW instance from here https://old.reddit.com/prefs/apps/), then run the ML model from the same file location as the data.
Updates to reddit API unfortunately make data collection extremely slow. Not a great deal I can do about that.
Sorry for how badly formatted most of it is, any questions feel free to contact me at robphilipson@outlook.com
