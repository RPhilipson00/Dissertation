0,jotfkb,I'm a Democrat Who Has Been Lurking Here for the Past Few Days,"So obviously as the title reads, I am a democrat and I've been reading the posts you guys put up here. With the election going on I figured I would try and get a perspective from the other side. I would like to say that the vast majority of you all seem like great people. I know that Reddit leans so far left that it might fall off the edge of the internet eventually, so I understand how being republican/conservative on this app can be frustrating. I actually agree with a lot of the points and arguments you guys make, I do disagree with some, but not nearly as many as I thought I would. I just think that it's the far extremists on both sides that are making everything seem so damn polarized right now. In reality, I bet 95% of us want similar things, but the media makes it seem as though we are polar opposites. I'm not sure about you all but I am tired of all of this. I am tired of the hate from the extremists on both ends, I'm tired of the politics smothering social media platforms, I am tired of this awful tension in the air all the time, and I am tired of being told that other Americans are my ""enemy"". I want to feel united as a country, not divided. After reading a ton of posts here over the past two days it seems like a lot of you all feel the same.

Edit 2: Thank you all for the awards, I feel like I need to prepare a speech or something. But as I mentioned before, all the messages and comments that I have seen so far have been nothing but overwhelmingly positive. It gives me a lot of hope for the future. ",340918507721085869,1

3,iuw1po,Longtime D voting R this year,"As I reminded myself this is the same media from 2001 that convinced their own people it was okay to bomb and completely destabilize the Middle East “because they had ISIS”, I decided to open my mind.

I attended BOTH rallies, Trump’s and Biden’s and needless to say, my mind was blown when I went to Trump’s. I never experienced such a magnitude of patriotism and unity. Numerous black people and other POCs were there, the majority of mainstream news would never show that. They looked happy and they were being treated equally from what I saw. People didn’t even treat them like black people, they were regular people like all other people. The primary message of the rally was to make our country better and the vibes were nothing but positive and energetic. In comparison, Biden’s rally was all about why Trump is a bad president and the energy was absolutely negative. People were angry and bitter, looking as if they were ready to beat up whoever expressed their support for Trump. This opened my eyes and made me realize where the hatred is truly coming from. As a longtime Democrat, I will be voting for Trump. We must start improving our country through unity, love, and positivity, which is completely opposite from what Democrats want at the moment.

Edit 1: clarification: what I mean by “People didn’t treat them like black people” is that they did not intentionally sympathize and treat them like victims just because they were black. They treated them like all other people regardless of the skin color. Sorry, English isn’t my first language and the wording could have been better.

Edit 2: thank you so much for all the awards! Never had an award before. :) This kind of outcome is not what I expected, let’s continue to stay united!

Edit 3: if you reported this post or feel the need to report, I strongly encourage you to open your mind and attend BOTH events instead of having all your thoughts formed by the mainstream news. Ability to keep your mind open and listen to both sides through unbiased lens is an extremely vital skill to have nowadays. If you still don’t agree with me, I still love you and will never treat you differently solely because of your political stance. Cheers!",8795340433800,1

6,hce0kx,"Why I, a black teenager, don't agree with black lives matter","Before people spam ""whitewashed"", I wanna make it clear that this isn't just gonna be some trash racist post

I feel like the message created by black lives matter is very different to that of the civil rights movement 56 years ago. That movement was one that strived to end both racial division and racial inequality. I can certainly see the stance against racial inequality in BLM, but not racial division.

MLK preached to Americans about black and white Americans being in unison. He promoted the meaning of America's creed, and promoted that black and white destiny are part of one another. He had a dream where the black and white people identified as Americans before they identified by their colour. Unfortunately, this is not the message BLM creates.

BLM has managed to make white people who have felt prejudice towards black people feel even stronger about this by creating demands like defunding police departments (And there is no denying,  police do far more good than harm in society, so defunding them will reduce a lot of the good they do) and by tearing down and destroying the history of countries (such as statues in America and Britain). These attacks on history are like an attack on the pride of people who feel strongly about the importance of their country's history. It has also managed to make black people who strongly hate racism hate it to the point where they want to fight it through violence, and has convinced them that racism is the blame for all problems in their lives.

As you can see above, the message created by BLM is very different to that of the civil rights movement, and I think it's almost like an insult to the legacy of MLK that this is where the struggle against racism has come to.

Another problem with BLM is the fight against systematic racism they preach about, because the truth is, systematic simply isn't real. Every citizen in countries like America has complete equality of opportunity. Everyone is given an equal opportunity to rise to the top. However, not everyone has the same starting point. And the truth is, a higher proportion of the black population in America and these countries begins at a low starting point than the proportion of white people who do. But this isn't because of systematic racism. The system isn't causing this. This is because of historical racism. For the majority of it's history, America has been a racist country, where people of certain skin colours do not have equal opportunities. There has been equality for only 56 years, compared to the roughly 200 years of systematic racisn. This means that, no matter what the system does, there is still going to be inequality between majority black and majority white communities. This is something everyone must accept, and must understand that the solution to this comes in two parts. The government providing funding to black communities to go towards education and quality of life, and black people in these communities understanding that they must take responsibility for their futures and their families' futures (meaning that this mentality of blaming systematic racism must stop).

I feel like the solution to all of this is a movement that wouldn't use methods of violence whatsoever, and instead of protesting against systematic racism which simply isn't real, it should preach to Americans of all races the importance of American values, which seem to have been forgotten over the generations. Through this, I hope, Americans can become united under a single national culture, and would no longer see themselves as divided from each other. It would also convince people in black communities to stop the ideas in black culture that have caused a lack of responsibility, causing things like single motherhood rate since the civil rights movement to go up by 40%.

I doubt that this message will reach many people. Mabye it will be censored. Mabye it will be ignored because of my age. But I really hope to see changes in how the world views race, changes I know we can reach, but not in the way we are currently doing it.

Edit: Thank you for 1k upvotes. It feels great to know that people actually agreed with this.",-8193461692799380816,1
7,l2kjlh,The Media Won,"Hey guys,

im sitting over here in Europe (Italy) and I am just amazed how the media changed it's attitude towards the US in a matter of days!

The last 4 years they didnt write anything good about the US, about President Trump or about the Republican Party. And on inauguration day there were like hundrets of articles how good this is for the world, how Biden is the saviour of western civilization and that all Problems will be gone soon.

Where did investigative journalism go? The whole media apparatus is purely political nowdays. They dont care about the Hunter Biden story for example but as soon as Trump misspells a word they go craaazy.

The media is acting like a child who finally got their toy they wanted for so long.

It is disgusting! And the sad thing is we cant do nothing about it.

The media is the real Enemy of the 21st century! Not just in the US, but in the entire world!

2- Click on the 3 bars on upper right corner and then click the Donate button.
3- Scroll down to Number 2- Read about Actblue Charities (this is where all the donations are going).
4- Go to https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/expenditures.php?cycle=2020&cmte=C00401224
*⬆️ This page will show you where the money has gone that has been donated to Actblue Charities.
5- Click “Expenditures”.
6- Scroll down until you see “Top Vendors/Recipients”.

So if for some reason you don’t understand what you’re seeing what this page is telling you is that hundreds of millions of dollars that have been donated to the black lives matter movement are instead donated directly to Democratic politicians.

Hundreds of millions of dollars donated are not even going to black communities to help in any way, shape, or form! Over 300 MILLION DOLLARS alone went towards “Bernie for President” and Biden’s campaign...none of that went to help black communities AT ALL!

16,j9k80m,"Well, I'm voting straight-ticket Republican, Trump and all","I made this username a couple years ago and that was my sentiment at the time. I was never a 'vote blue no matter who' type because that mentality allows the DNC to do whatever they want, and I frankly won't be told to fall in line. I voted 3rd party in '04, Obama in '08, 3rd party in '12 and '16. State and local politicians I've voted for have mostly been Democrat. My views have never fallen cleanly on one side or the other, but I've mostly leaned liberal.

This brings me to Why I'm Voting Republican:  
1. Woke shit. I've been on the receiving end of woke hatred over men who fancy themselves women for a long time. I'm well acquainted with critical theory and all its crazy spawn. I'm not down for the struggle sessions, the authoritarianism, the illiberal silencing of dissent. Now that we have Evergreen playing out in the streets, schools, and HR departments across the Western world, I have no choice but to vote for the party standing against it. This alone would be enough for me to vote for Trump.  
2. Media is lying to me. I believed those pictures of kids in cages were put there by Trump. I believed the shooting of Breonna Taylor was the result of a no-knock warrant executed on the wrong address. I believed Trump said neo-Nazis and white supremacists marching with tiki torches were ""fine people."" Turns out I was a sucker, and god damn am I *tired* of this ""peaceful protester"" shit the media is on about.  
3. Fuck the DNC. I wanted Bernie in 2016 and we all know how dirty they did him. When Trump won, my immediate thought was 'at least the DNC will learn their fucking lesson.' Well friends, they're much more resistant to learning than I anticipated. This time around there were a few candidates I could have gotten on board with, but of course the DNC won't let anyone remotely subversive get on the ticket. Fuck em.  
4. LAW AND ORDER. I live in Oregon. It's not going well. Fuck antifa. Fuck BLM. Fuck Kate Brown. Fuck Ted Wheeler. Fuck everyone allowing tent cities full of junkies to blight the landscape. Fuck every 'ACAB' sniveling child.  
5. Yay middle east peace deals.  
6. Fuck China.  
7. Biden is frail and will be 78 and Harris is terrifying and I haaaate her.  
8. Working class. I don't know when the Democrats decided they weren't the party of labor, but now they mostly look down their ivory tower noses at anyone with a little mud on their boots.  
9. Democrats talking about court packing. No, no, no, hell no.  
10. Democrats talking about getting rid of the electoral college, thus disenfranchising the interests of rural people. Nope, never gonna happen.  
11. I'm patriotic. I don't like that seeing an American flag on someone's house, vehicle, or clothing is a pretty good indicator of them being a Republican. Regarding the Democrat party and liberals in general, where is their love of country? “National pride is to countries what self-respect is to individuals: a necessary condition for self-improvement.” ― Richard Rorty

As for Trump himself, I think he's a boor. But he's not as big of a bastard as I had believed and I understand him a bit better. He's gonna win for sure, which is not something I thought before the riots started. I'm preemptively pissed about the future of abortion rights, but at least my free speech and gun rights will remain intact. With those two, I have a seat at the table to fight for the rest. 

I'm honestly hoping for a landslide because I think it might be the only thing that can slap liberals hard enough they wake up and get on a better path. The nation works best when there is a healthy push and pull between liberalism and conservatism, and we need to be able to agree on the foundational structures of our country. I see a huge number of left-leaning people refusing to come to the table to talk and wanting to break our system when they don't get their way, and making it clear that won't win them power is the issue of the election.",1300641121842484221,1

22,j82tlu,VP Debate: one part that really stuck with me on the difference between Democrats and Republicans,"I was watching a rerun of  the VP debate yesterday (I know I’m late) and one line (I guess one part) that really stuck with me about the difference between Democrats and Republicans. 

I forget what exactly was said but Harris was berating Pence for not social distancing / wearing masks / etc. Pence’s reply really stuck with me because it was along the lines of “You want to tell people what to do, we trust the American people are smart enough to think for themselves”

And that line really really stuck with me. I came here from Russia years ago and while I was born after the iron curtain fell, my parents weren’t so lucky. So many stories about “knowing a guy”, countless instances of “back door favors”

These aren’t evil people, just regular folks trying to get by (grandma was a teacher, gramps was an engineer in a factory). All this shit they had to do, was because the fucking government made regular life impossible.  To me even I hate authority on that level, I just hate people telling me what to do because I feel like “hey man do you think I’m dumb “

Democrats seem to be in this backslide or more and more regulations and I saw it first hand on a recent trip to Cali. While I can’t put my finger on it, the whole place just felt “Over regulated”, which is a real fucking shame because it’s gorgeous there. 

Republicans on the other hand are more keen on stepping back and building a solid foundation for you to go off of. I don’t need the government doing everything for me, just please give me the basics and I got it from here. 

I feel like Pence’s comment is a complete reflection of this difference in ideas. I don’t agree with everything the Republicans do but one thing I am 100% on board with is the notion of “hey we’re just going to leave you the fuck alone”

Edit: Thanks for the pin mods.

That very well might be true, but the thing is, people can die of more than one reason and I heavily doubt that someone crushing your neck while you're going into respiratory failure isn't a compounding factor. 

Regardless of all that though, you cannot be a libertarian and argue that the jackboot of the government and full government violence is justified when someone is possibly committing a crime that is valued at $20. (Also, as an aside, I've served my time in retail and I know that most people who try to pay with fake money don't even know it, they usually were approached by someone asking for them to break a $20 in the parking lot or something.  I would not have called the police on Floyd, just refused his sale with a polite explanation).

58,il2l8t,Licking the boots of mega corporations is not libertarian.,"Are mega corporations a good thing for freedom? In my opinion... no. I don't think Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Nestle, Coca Cola, etc. Care about you or me. I think they care about one thing: Money. And they use that money to buy only one thing: Power.

And here's the deal. I'm sick and tired of listening to Libertarians lick mega corporations boots. I'm sick and tired of libertarians saying ""But they worked hard to get where they are"". Sure. There was hard work involved. But there was a lot of predatory business practices, backroom deals, and law breaking that got many, if not all of these companies where they are today. 

Amazon has a reputation for buying around 20-30% stake in a small company, demanding trade secrets, then creating a competitive company, selling the stake, bankrupting the small company, then stealing all of the employees for themselves. \\This is very much illegal. And for good reason. It also just accepted a joint 10 Billion dollar contract along with Microsoft from the government to do defense contracting. They also own multiple companies which are working on the cure for cancer. Are they going to give the cancer cure away for free? Nope. They're going to sell it to who can afford it. So fuck you, kids with leukemia! Your parents are plumbers. Not executives.

Amazon also owns the Washington Post, which provides the company a steady stream of propaganda for both Bezos and his brand. This media company, the moment Bezos acquired it, suddenly was pumping out pro corporation propaganda. 

Speaking of propaganda, Rupert Murdoch and 14 other people own all of your news sites. And they all happen to be billionaires. So of course it can be difficult to find other Billionaires' dirty laundry

As for the food supply, 10 companies own 90% of the entire food supply vertically and horizontally for the US. That includes 70,000 separate food choices. And since processed food has been introduced, which makes up 75% of our diet, chronic diseases and medical costs have skyrocketed, creating a dependency on big pharma for treatment. 

Big Pharma will take large amounts of taxpayer money, use it to develop a drug, patent said drug, and then sell it back to taxpayers for 1,000% of what it costs to produce. Just look at insulin in the united states, or the new HIV drugs. WE PAID FOR THAT GUYS. So after we paid for the solutions to the problems that the 10 companies above created, Big Pharma charges us a markup of 1,000%. It doesn't surprise me that so much misinformation revolves around health. These guys have a big amount to lose!

Apple has been trying desperately to dismantle ""Right to repair"" for small businesses. This means for apple products that you *personally own*, you would be required to have your repairs done by them. If this happens, every company will now have the right to require you repair or maintain their products at whatever price they choose. 

Bill gates' foundation (The Bill and Martha Gates foundation) Spends hundreds of millions lobbying congressmen and women every year. Bill will ""Donate"" money to the foundation, which then allocates the money to lobbying firms that he owns. 

Facebook lied to you, took your personal data, and then sold it to companies without your consent. 

Libertarianism is about freedom of choice. But quite frankly, freedom of choice is something every single one of these corporations want to take away from you. A free market means these corporations and business owners have to work hard to keep your business. Mega corporations do not create a free market. They create an oligarchy. Oligarchies, like monarchies are inherently not libertarian. Their sole purpose is to keep the business owners in power, and you without your freedom or liberty. 

Billionaires do not spend their money on big boats, golden toilets, or fancy cars. They spend their money to weed into government and stifle the free market so that they can create a system that works for them instead of us. Now, we have a billionaire authoritarian as our president!

62,haq8cw,As a black man I feel Black Lives Matter are becoming bullies and are actually hurting the Black community by segregating us further create a racial divides.,"This will be my 3rd attempt at making this post to get my voice heard. Hopefully this sub will let me exercise my right of free speech. 

I feel people outside the black race think that we all think alike and share the same beliefs but this is so far from the truth. It’s true that he who shouts the loudest gets the most attention and that is exactly what’s happening in our country at the moment. There’s millions of African Americans that share the same thoughts as me, but we get chewed out or canceled when our thoughts stray from the status quo. There’s many videos of us speaking out against this, but it doesn’t make the news as it goes against the narrative. 

A little About Me before I get into it:

1. I was born and raised in the “hood”. Newark, NJ to be exact. I still live here, not by choice but by necessity. 

2. I AM NOT OPPRESSED!! Yes I still live in the city I grew up in, it’s not the ghetto by any standard but it’s not the suburbs neither. I have my own apartment, a nice car, and good credit. Am I where I want to be in life? No, not even close. But I’m working towards it. Where I’m at right now is 100% my fault and on me. I’m where I’m at in life because of my life choices. Had nothing to do with anyone else of any race, it was me. And have a plan to get where I want to be and there’s no doubt in my mind that I will get there if I put in the work necessary. 

3. I’ve always been treated with respect by the police. To frame this I’m not just a black guy, I’m a very dark black guy. The black community comes in all shades from very fair skinned to very dark skinned. I fall into the darker category. I’ve gotten out of more tickets than I’ve received when being pulled over. I’ve never been to jail. One time I was put in handcuffs because I had a bench warrant because I didn’t pay a tiny ticket I completely forgot about. 

These cops were respectful the entire time. They even took me to the atm so I could get myself out.. lol..it was less than $200. They saw I wasn’t a threat and let me out of the handcuffs on the trip to the precinct. When we got their, the officer even apologized and said unfortunately I’d have to put the cuffs back on to walk into the precinct because it was policy. To add my license was suspended because of the unpaid ticket. But these officers drive me back to my vehicle and said “I can’t advise you to drive this car, but once we leave you can do what you want”. This proves treat people with respect you’ll get the same back. And I was definitely far from home in a area that you’d consider predominantly “white” if that’s a thing anyway. 

BLM:

I understand that they may have good intentions but they are going about it the wrong way. They are trying to get demands made by force and violence. I feel as though this is not the way to get things done as it’s just going to piss people off even more. Yeah you may get what you want, but it won’t be out of support but it what be out of fear. Fear of being canceled, fear of not being re-elected, fear of losing your job if you speak up against them. America is built on democracy. What I am seeing right now is not a democracy but a dictatorship. If you don’t agree with us then you are DONE. We’re going to cancel you and burn down your business.

The rioting and looting was the dumbest thing to do and should have been condemned by BLM. People say oh the business have insurance they can rebuild. First off, how are people supposed to go grocery shopping etc. if you burned down the businesses in your neighborhood? Secondly, when things like this happen businesses don’t usually come back. I’m from Newark,NJ. Back in the 60’s we had similar riots that lasted for days because of a rumor that a black man was beaten by the police. You can look the story up as it’s still a big event in history. But what I’m getting at is that my city is JUST NOW recovering from an event that happened over 50 years ago. These cities will never be the same, and I don’t mean that in a good way. Jobs will not return and these businesses are gone forever to never return. 

I want to be accepted for who I am. Not because the government or BLM said you have to or suffer the consequences. The way they are going about this is causing a bigger racial divide more than ever and is counterproductive in what their trying to achieve. 

Dr. Martin Luther King said “I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character”. 

Black Lives Matter don’t want that. They want special treatment for being born black. I want to get where I am because of my hard work. Not because I had to be hired to hit a “black” quota.

I’m rambling and don’t want to make this too long. But I wanted to get my opinion out there because me and others like me feel our voices are being stifled. And we are afraid to speak up because any deviation of opinion will get us canceled which is not right and makes this country no longer the democracy It used to be.

TLDR: Black lives matter is going about things the wrong way to bring change. I’m black and never felt oppressed because of my race. Things will get worse if we remain on this path.

Edit: [Here’s Proof](https://imgur.com/a/lVvHqCc) for those doubting my ethnicity. It’s sad I even have to do this. It actually helps my point above. You can’t be black if you think for yourself.

Things don't exist in a vaccuum of course corporations are made up of people and of course decisions are weighed with other factors in mind. 

&nbsp;

Edit3: Might as well just say: after all things considered, from a corporations unique workforce to the laws of land in which they are operating and whatever nuance you may think of, their main goal is too MAKE AS MUCH FUCKING MONEY AS POSSIBLE.

&nbsp;

Edit4: Many companies remain politically agnostic as some point out. Because that's what is best for profit. It's not fucking crazy or hard to understand why Facebook or Reddit SEEMS to lean socially left. It's a forum for speech on many topics and many topics overlap with politics. You don't go to fucking goddamn Safeway or Kroger to talk politics or world events. You go on reddit or facebook or twitter. They are EXACTLY THE TYPE OF PLACES YOU'D EXPECT TO APPEAR BIASED while their real goal is to make as much money as possible. It's why people don't use fucking 4Chan more, free speech is great for a corporation's platform until every other comment is some anonymous user or bot spamming Nazi bullshit calling people slurs. Then they quickly realize maybe this isn't the best way to get more people engaged in our platform.

Because those home invaders were cops.","Marvin Guy has been in jail for 7 years, without trial, facing the death penalty, because he allegedly killed one of the home invaders who broke into his home and opened fire on him. 

Why? 

Because those home invaders were cops. 

Killeen TX police had been surveilling Marvin's home for quite some time, based on a tip from an informant that he was selling drugs. Unable to prove that he had done anything, they decided to conduct a no-knock raid. The judge gave them a no-knock warrant in 5 minutes. 

At 5:30 in the morning on May 9, 2014, police broke into Marvin's home. 

Days earlier, a home invasion of a woman's home, which resulted in her being seriously injured, had shocked Marvin and his neighbors. 

Believing himself and his family to be in danger, Marvin defended himself, allegedly killing one of the officers. 

I say ""allegedly"" because it's possible that the officer died from friendly fire. During the raid, an officer tripped, and officers began firing everywhere, endangering themselves, Marvin, his girlfriend, and the entire complex. 

Once Marvin realized that the home invaders were police, he surrendered. Police responded by threatening to murder Marvin, and breaking his girlfriend's ribs. 

Police found no drugs in his home, not even for personal use. Nothing. 

Texas is a Castle Doctrine state, which means that the state government is supposed to recognize Marvin's right to defend his home with lethal force if he is threatened. 

In fact, a Texas man named Henry Goedrich Magee had been released just a few months earlier after killing a police officer when they no-knock raided his home. 

And earlier this year, the City of Killeen government passed a ban on no-knock raids, which makes the way that police broke into Marvin's home illegal. 

Despite all of this, Marvin was charged with murder of a police officer, which carries a maximum penalty of execution. 

He has sat in a jail for 7 years and counting, with no trial. He has dismissed 3 different public defenders, whom he says all pressured him to accept a plea bargain. 

This is what the war on drugs, the failed criminal justice system, and the ""thin blue line"" culture of police lawlessness looks like in this country.

Free Marvin Guy.

We're going to work to free Marvin Guy, and here's how you can help: 

1. Contact Bell County District Attorney Henry Garza at (800) 460-2355 ext. 5215, or by mail at, P.O. Box 540, Belton, TX 76513, and RESPECTFULLY let him know that the world is watching and charges against Marvin should be dropped. 

YOU are the Power.

""In the land of the free, every citizen is guaranteed to be presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. Sadly, however, this guarantee is often suspended for many folks who rot in jail for years waiting to prove their innocence. Because he’s yet to proven guilty, Marvin Guy is innocent until proven so. And for the last 7 years, he’s been innocent, in jail, with no trial.""

80,do8g3q,LETS TALK GUN VIOLENCE!,"
There are about 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, this number is not disputed. (1)

U.S. population 328 million as of January 2018. (2)

Do the math: 0.00915% of the population dies from gun related actions each year.

Statistically speaking, this is insignificant. It's not even a rounding error.

What is not insignificant, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths:

• 22,938 (76%) are by suicide which can't be prevented by gun laws (3)

• 987 (3%) are by law enforcement, thus not relevant to Gun Control discussion. (4)

• 489 (2%) are accidental (5)

So no, ""gun violence"" isn't 30,000 annually, but rather 5,577... 0.0017% of the population.

Still too many? Let's look at location:

298 (5%) - St Louis, MO (6)

327 (6%) - Detroit, MI (6)

328 (6%) - Baltimore, MD (6)

764 (14%) - Chicago, IL (6)

That's over 30% of all gun crime. In just 4 cities.

This leaves 3,856 for for everywhere else in America... about 77 deaths per state. Obviously some States have higher rates than others

Yes, 5,577 is absolutely horrific, but let's think for a minute...

But what about other deaths each year?

70,000+ die from a drug overdose (7)

49,000 people die per year from the flu (8)

37,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities (9)

Now it gets interesting:

250,000+ people die each year from preventable medical errors. (10)

You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital!

610,000 people die per year from heart disease (11)

Even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save about twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.).

A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides.

Simple, easily preventable, 10% reductions!

We don't have a gun problem... We have a political agenda and media sensationalism problem.

Here are some statistics about defensive gun use in the U.S. as well.

https://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3#14

Page 15:

Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals, with estimates of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million (Kleck, 2001a), in the context of about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008 (BJS, 2010).

That's a minimum 500,000 incidents/assaults deterred, if you were to play devil's advocate and say that only 10% of that low end number is accurate, then that is still more than the number of deaths, even including the suicides.

Older study, 1995:

https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6853&context=jclc

Page 164

The most technically sound estimates presented in Table 2 are those based on the shorter one-year recall period that rely on Rs' first-hand accounts of their own experiences (person-based estimates). These estimates appear in the first two columns. They indicate that each year in the U.S. there are about 2.2 to 2.5 million DGUs of all types by civilians against humans, with about 1.5 to 1.9 million of the incidents involving use of handguns.

r/dgu is a great sub to pay attention to, when you want to know whether or not someone is defensively using a gun

86,l5e6ug,"CMV: The 2nd Amendment will eventually be significantly weakened, and no small part of that will be the majority of 2A advocates hypocrisy regarding their best defense.","I'd like to start off by saying I'm a gun owner.   I've shot since I was a little kid, and occasionally shoot now.   I used to hunt, but since my day job is wandering around in the woods the idea of spending my vacation days wandering around in the woods has lost a lot of it's appeal.   I wouldn't describe myself as a ""Gun Nut"" or expert, but I certainly like my guns, and have some favorites, go skeet shooting, etc.  I bought some gun raffle tickets last week.  Gonna go, drink beer, and hope to win some guns.

I say this because I want to make one thing perfectly clear up front here, as my last post people tended to focus on my initial statement, and not my thoughts on why that was harmful to libertarians.  That was my bad, I probably put the first bit as more of a challenge than was neccessary.

**I am not for weakening the 2nd amendment.   I think doing so would be bad.   I just think it will happen if specific behaviors among 2A advocates are not changed.**

I'd like to start out with some facts up front.   If you quibble about them for a small reason, I don't really care unless they significantly change the conclusion I draw, but they should not be controversial.

1.) Most of the developed world has significant gun control and fewer gun deaths/school shootings.

2.) The strongest argument for no gun control is ""fuck you we have a constitution.""

2a.) some might say it's to defend against a tyrannical government but I think any honest view of our current political situation would end in someone saying ""Tyrannical to who?   who made you the one to decide that?"".   I don't think a revolution could be formed right now that did not immediately upon ending be seen and indeed be a tyranny over the losing side.

Given that, the focus on the 2nd amendment as the most important right (the right that protects the others) over all else has already drastically weakened the constitutional argument, and unless attitudes change I don't see any way that argument would either hold up in court or be seriously considered by anyone.    Which leaves as the only defense, in the words of Jim Jeffries, ""Fuck you, I like guns."" and I don't think that will be sufficient.

I'd also like to say I know it's not all 2a advocates that do this, but unless they start becoming a larger percentage and more vocal, I don't think that changes the path we are on.

Consider:Overwhelmingly the same politically associated groups that back the 2A has been silent when:

The 2nd should be protecting all arms, not just firearms.   Are there constitutional challenges being brought to the 4 states where tasers are illegal?   stun guns, Switchblades, knives over 6"", blackjacks, brass knuckles are legal almost nowhere, mace, pepper spray over certain strengths, swords, hatchets, machetes, billy clubs, riot batons, night sticks, and many more arms all have states where they are illegal.

the 4th amendment is taken out back and shot,

the emoluments clause is violated daily with no repercussions

the 6th is an afterthought to the cost savings of trumped up charges to force plea deals, with your ""appointed counsel"" having an average of 2 hours to learn about your case

a major party where all just cheering about texas suing pennsylvania, a clear violation of the 11th

when the 8th stops ""excessive fines and bails"" and yet we have 6 figure bails set for the poor over minor non violent crimes, and your non excessive ""fine"" for a speeding ticket of 25 dollars comes out to 300 when they are done tacking fees onto it.   Not to mention promoting and pardoning Joe Arpaio, who engaged in what I would certainly call cruel, but is inarguably unusual punishment for prisoners.   No one is sentenced to being intentionally served expired food.

the ninth and tenth have been a joke for years thanks to the commerce clause

a major party just openly campaigned on removing a major part of the 14th amendment in birthright citizenship.   That's word for word part of the amendment.

The 2nd already should make it illegal to strip firearm access from ex-cons.

The 15th should make it illegal to strip voting rights from ex-convicts

The 24th should make it illegal to require them to pay to have those voting rights returned.

And as far as defend against the government goes, these groups also overwhelmingly ""Back the Blue"" and support the militarization of the police force.

If 2A advocates don't start supporting the whole constitution instead of just the parts they like, eventually those for gun rights will use these as precedent to drop it down to ""have a pocket knife""  


Edit: by request, **TLDR:** By not attempting to strengthen all amendments and the constitution, and even occasionally cheering on the destruction of other amendments, The constitutionality of the 2nd amendment becomes a significantly weaker defense, both legally and politically.     


Getting up in arms about a magazine restriction but cheering on removing ""all persons born in the united states are citizens of the united states"" is not politically or legally helpful.

94,jbmg40,Libertarian Police,"I was shooting heroin and reading “The Fountainhead” in the front seat of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in. I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.

“Bad news, detective. We got a situation.”

“What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?”

“Worse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars’ worth of bitcoins.”

The heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. “What kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless. They represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?”

“Not yet. But mark my words: we’re going to figure out who did this and we’re going to take them down … provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.”

“Easy, chief,” I said. “Any rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.”

He laughed. “That’s why you’re the best I got, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.”

“Don’t worry,” I said. “I’m on it.”

I put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside.

“Home Depot™ Presents the Police!®” I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. “Nobody move unless you want to!” They didn’t.

“Now, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?” No one spoke up.

“Come on,” I said. “Don’t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?”

It didn’t seem like they did.

“Seriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I’m just going to stand here and not solve this case. Cash is fine, but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.”

Nothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn’t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing.

I figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it.

“Subway™ Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!®” I yelled.

Too late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.

“Stop right there!” I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby, it will never happen.

I was losing him. “Listen, I’ll pay you to stop!” I yelled. “What would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I’ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‘Bob Barr ‘08’ extra-large long-sleeved men’s T-shirt!”

He turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose.

“All right, all right!” the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. “I give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.”

“Why’d you do it?” I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos™ Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs® on the guy.

“Because I was afraid.”

“Afraid?”

“Afraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,” he said. “I’m a central banker.”

I wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head.

“Let this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street,” I said. “No matter how many bitcoins you steal, you’ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.”

He nodded, because he knew I was right. Then he swiped his credit card to pay me.",1498582750559307936,1

This is seriously starting to drive me fucking nuts and I have no idea how it doesn’t make other people incredibly upset. Where the fuck is my money going to?!? What is it being spent on?!? I understand that I’m benefitting from the US having a military (sort of), roads/infrastructure, etc. The ONLY things I, and the majority of Americans actually benefit from probably don’t even account for 10-20% of the total income taxed out of me.

I will NEVER, EVER benefit from the other 80-90% of the money I pay to taxes. Maybe social security when I get older, but for some reason I fuckung doubt that will still exist - and SS alone is 7%. I don’t like the idea of free healthcare, housing, college, etc, but when I’m paying 45% of every dollar I own to taxes then I should atleast expect to receive SOME OF THOSE BENEFITS!!! BUT I DON’T! I GET ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN RETURN!!!

How are Americans just blatantly okay with this?? We are literally being robbed and have nothing to show for it. It makes me sick to my stomach, I’d be a millionaire right now if I was only taxed on governmental services myself and the majority of Americans actually use/get.

This is NOT what the founding fathers had in mind when they created America. This is just fucking sad and it completely demoralizes me to give away 45% of everything I own for ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

\- DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 11. One of the non-parties Ms. Giuffre “named” repeatedly in the joinder motion was Ms. Maxwell. According to the “lurid details” of Ms. Giuffre included in the motion, Ms. Maxwell personally was involved in a “sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme” created by Epstein: § Ms. Maxwell “approached” Ms. Giuffre in 1999 when Ms. Giuffre was “fifteen years old” to recruit her into the scheme. § Ms. Maxwell was “one of the main women” Epstein used to “procure under-aged girls for sexual activities.” § Ms. Maxwell was a “primary co-conspirator” with Epstein in his scheme. Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page6 of 66 7 § She “persuaded” Ms. Giuffre to go to Epstein’s mansion “in a fashion very similar to the manner in which Epstein and his other co-conspirators coerced dozens of other children.” § At the mansion, when Ms. Giuffre began giving Epstein a massage, he and Ms. Maxwell “turned it into a sexual encounter.” § Epstein “with the assistance of” Ms. Maxwell “converted \[Ms. Giuffre\] into . . . a ‘sex slave.’” Id. Ms. Giuffre was a “sex slave” from “about 1999 through 2002.” § Ms. Maxwell also was a “co-conspirator in Epstein’s sexual abuse.” § Ms. Maxwell “appreciated the immunity” she acquired under Epstein’s plea agreement, because the immunity protected her from prosecution “for the crimes she committed in Florida.” § Ms. Maxwell “participat\[ed\] in the sexual abuse of \[Ms. Giuffre\] and others.” § Ms. Maxwell “took numerous sexually explicit pictures of underage girls involved in sexual activities, including \[Ms. Giuffre\].” Id. She shared the photos with Epstein. § As part of her “role in Epstein’s sexual abuse ring,” Ms. Maxwell “connect\[ed\]” Epstein with “powerful individuals” so that Epstein could traffic Ms. Giuffre to these persons. § Ms. Giuffre was “forced to have sexual relations” with Prince Andrew in § “\[Ms. Maxwell’s\] apartment” in London. Ms. Maxwell “facilitated” Ms. Giuffre’s § sex with Prince Andrew “by acting as a ‘madame’ for Epstein.” § Ms. Maxwell “assist\[ed\] in internationally trafficking” Ms. Giuffre and “numerous other young girls for sexual purposes.” § Ms. Giuffre was “forced” to watch Epstein, Ms. Maxwell and others “engage in illegal sexual acts with dozens of underage girls.”

See McCawley Dec. at Exhibits 1, Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page55 of 66 56 19, 21, Banasiak Dep. Tr. at 8:21-9:16; 14:20-15:6; Alessi Dep. Tr. at 23:11-23:20; Rodriguez Dep. Tr. at 169:1-169:4.

Page 244

\- Rodriguez, the house butler from 2004 through 2005, a time period that revealed daily sexual abuse of underage females, testified that Maxwell kept a list of the local girls who were giving massages at her desk, and that Maxwell kept nude photos of girls on her computer. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 21, Rodriguez Dep. Tr. at 238:4-238:22; 302:19-303:10; 306:1- 306:24.

\- Recarey testified that when the search warrant was executed, the house had been sanitized and the computers removed from the home. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 72:25-73:15.

\- Banaziak testified that the computers were removed by Adriana Ross, another employee who answered to Maxwell. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 19, Banaziak Dep. Tr. at 54:7-22.

Page 245

\- Tony Figueroa, Ms. Giuffre's ex-boyfriend, did testify that Maxwell personally requested that he find and bring girls to Epstein for sex once Ms. Giuffre had escaped, and that when he brought the girls Maxwell interacted with them. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 4, Figueroa Dep. Tr. at 200:6-18; 228:23-229:21.

\- Rodriguez testified unequivocally that Maxwell was ""the boss"" and that she knew everything that was going on. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 21, Rodriguez Dep. Tr. 169:1-169:4.

\- Nude photographs were displayed throughout Epstein’s home. Furthermore, Alfredo Rodriguez testified to Maxwell having pornography on her computer. Rodriguez Dep. Tr. 150:10-17; 306:1-306:24.

\- He also testified to there being a collage of nude photos in Epstein's closet. Id. 253:14-254:18. That collage was eventually taken into evidence by Detective Recarey, who testified to that fact in his deposition. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 73:19-73:24.

\- **And those photos are still in the possession of the FBI or US Attorney's Office. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 74:2-74:7.**

\- Ronaldo Rizzo, who visited the home on numerous occasions and who was reprimanded by Maxwell herself for looking at the nude photos. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 14, Rizzo Dep. Tr. at 25:19-26:20.

Page 246

\- Johanna Sjorberg testified that the Defendant bought her a camera for the specific purpose of her taking nude photos of herself. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 16 Sjoberg Tr. at 150.

\- Virginia Giuffre testified that there was a nude photograph of her at the house. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5 Virginia Giuffre Tr. at 232 and 333.

Page 264

\- Johanna Sjoberg, testified that Defendant recruited her under the guise of a legitimate assistant position, but asked her to perform sexual massages for Epstein, and punished her when she didn’t cause Epstein to orgasm.

\- Tony Figueroa testified that Defendant contacted him to recruit high school-aged girls for Epstein, and also testified that Maxwell and Epstein participated in multiple threesomes with Virginia Giuffre.

\- the butler for Defendant’s close friend witnessed, first-hand, a fifteen-year-old Swedish girl crying and shaking because Defendant was attempting to force her to have sex with Epstein and she refused.

\- Call this the “yes-I’m-a-sextrafficker-but-only-of-sixteen-year-old-girls” defense.

Page 265

\- Flight logs even reveal twenty-three flights that Defendant shared with Ms. Giuffre – although Defendant claims she is unable to remember even a single one of those flights.

\- Defendant’s heavy and extensive involvement in both Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking ring and in recruiting Ms. Giuffre, living with her and Jeffrey Epstein in the same homes while Ms. Giuffre was a minor, and traveling with Ms. Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein – including 23 documented flights. Even the house staff testified that Defendant and Ms. Giuffre were regularly together.

Page 266

\- The record evidence in this case shows that Defendant shared a household with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein for many years. While there, she actively took part in recruiting underage girls and young women for sex with Epstein, as well as scheduling the girls to come over, and maintaining a list of the girls and their phone numbers.

\- Ms. Giuffre was indisputably a minor when Defendant recruited her to have sex with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Thereafter, Ms. Giuffre flew on Epstein’s private jets – the – Lolita Express” – with Defendant at least 23 times.

\- Ms. Sjoberg’s account of her experiences with Defendant are chillingly similar. As with Ms. Giuffre, Defendant, a perfect stranger, approached Ms. Sjoberg while trolling Ms. Sjoberg’s school grounds. She lured Ms. Sjoberg into her and Epstein’s home under the guise of a legitimate job of answering phones, a pretext that lasted only a day. A young college student, Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page12 of 74 5 nearly 2,000 miles from home, Defendant soon instructed Ms. Sjoberg to massage Epstein, and made it clear that Sjoberg’s purpose was to bring Epstein to orgasm during these massages so that Defendant did not have to do it.

Page 268

\- Ms. Sjoberg also testified about sexual acts that occurred with her, Prince Andrew, and Ms. Giuffre, when she and Defendant were staying at Epstein’s Manhattan mansion.

\- **Prince Andrew using a puppet to touch Ms. Giuffre’s breast while using a hand to touch Ms. Sjoberg’s breast.**

\- Tony Figueroa testified that Plaintiff told him about threesomes Ms. Giuffre had with Defendant and Epstein which included the use of strap-ons.

\- Figueroa also testified that Defendant called him to ask if he had found any other girls for Epstein, thereby acting as procurer of girls for Epstein:

Page 270

\- Mr. Rizzo testified - through tears – how, while working at Dubin’s house, he observed Defendant bring a 15 year old Swedish girl to Dubin’s house. In distress, the 15 year old girl tearfully explained to him that Defendant tried to force her to have sex with Epstein through threats and stealing her passport.

Page 271

\- Lyn Miller is Ms. Giuffre’s mother. She testified that when Ms. Giuffre started living with Defendant, Defendant became Ms. Giuffre’s “new momma.” 10 Incredulously, Defendant testified that she barely remembered Ms. Giuffre.

\- Detective Recarey led the Palm Beach Police’s investigation of Epstein. He testified that Defendant procured girls for Epstein, and that he sought to question her in relation to his investigation, but could not contact her due to the interference of Epstein’s lawyer.

Page 272

\- Notably, at Defendant’s deposition, Defendant refused to admit that she flew with Ms. Giuffre, and denied that she appeared on Epstein’s pilot’s flight logs.13

\- However, David Rodgers, Epstein pilot, testified that the passenger listed on his flight logs bearing the initials – GM – was, in fact, Ghislaine Maxwell, and that he was the pilot on at least 23 flights in which Defendant flew with Plaintiff. 14 The dates of those flights show that Ms. Giuffre was an underage child on many of them when she flew with Defendant.

\- Both Sarah Kellen and Nadia Marcinkova lived with Jeffrey Epstein for many years. They both invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about Defendant’s participation in recruiting underage girls for sex with Epstein.

Page 273

\- Jeffrey Epstein invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about Defendant’s involvement in procuring underage girls for sex with him.

Page 274

\- Defendant has not been able to procure a single witness - not one – to testify that Defendant did not procure girls for sex with Epstein or participate in the sex.

\- Even one of her own witnesses, Tony Figueroa, testified that she both procured girls and participated in the sex.

\- Another one of Defendant’s witnesses, Ms. Giuffre’s mother, named Defendant as Ms. Giuffre’s “new mamma.” Indeed, those who knew her well, who spent considerable time with her in Epstein’s shared household, like Juan Alessi, Alfredo Rodriguez and Joanna Sjoberg, have testified that she was Epstein’s procuress.

\- Others who lived with her – Jeffrey Epstein, Nadia Marcinkova, and Sarah Kellen – invoked the Fifth Amendment so as not to answer questions on the same. No one has testified to the contrary.

\- **Defendant has never offered a legal explanation for what she was doing with, and why she was traveling with, a minor child on 21 flights while she was a child, including 6 international flights, aboard a convicted pedophile’s private jet all over the world.**

Page 275

\- Defendant never offered an explanation regarding Ms. Giuffre’s photographs of her, Defendant, and Epstein.

\- She never offered a legal explanation for why Prince Andrew was photographed with his hand around Ms. Giuffre’s bare waist while she was a minor child, while posing with Defendant, inside Defendant’s house in London.

\- This photograph corroborates Ms. Giuffre’s claims, and there is no other reasonable explanation why an American child should be in the company of adults not her kin, in the London house owned by the girlfriend of a now convicted sex offender.

\- Ms. Giuffre also produced pictures of herself taken when she was in New York with Defendant and Epstein, and from a trip to Europe with Defendant and Epstein.

Page 276

\- Ms. Giuffre has produced a number of pictures of herself taken at the Zorro Ranch, Epstein’s New Mexico Ranch.

\- Among other nude photos, which included full nudes of Defendant, Ms. Giuffre produced images of females that the Palm Beach Police confiscated during the execution of the 22 See McCawley Dec at Exhibit 42, GIUFFRE007175; 007173. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page22 of 74 15 warrant, including one photograph revealing the bare bottom of a girl who appears to be prepubescent.

Page 277

\- In 2008, the United States Attorney’s office for the Southern District of Florida identified Ms. Giuffre as a protected “victim” of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex abuse. The U.S. Attorney mailed Ms. Giuffre a notice of her rights as a crime victim under the CVRA.

\- Ms. Giuffre has provided extensive medical records in this case, including medical records from the time when Defendant was sexually abusing and trafficking her. Ms. Giuffre produced records supporting her claim of being sexually abused in New York resulting in both 23 See McCawley Dec at Exhibit 44, GIUFFRE007584. 24 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 30, GIUFFRE 002216-002218, Victim Notification Letter. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page23 of 74 16 Defendant and Epstein taking Plaintiff to New York Presbyterian Hospital in New York while she was a minor. The dates on the hospital records show she was seventeen years old.

Page 278

\- Defendant propounded wildly overbroad requests for production concerning the past eighteen years of Ms. Giuffre’s medical history. Defendant repeatedly and vehemently argued to the Court that it was essential to procure every page of these records in a fanfare of unnecessary motion practice

\- Ms. Giuffre sought counseling from a psychologist for the trauma she continued to experience after being abused by Defendant and Epstein. A 2011 psychological treatment record, written by her treating psychologist, unambiguously describes Defendant as Ms. Giuffre’s abuser.

Page 279

\- Years before Defendant defamed her, Ms. Giuffre confided in her treating psychologist that Maxwell recruited her for sex with Epstein.

\- Detective Recarey, the lead investigator of the criminal investigation into Epstein and his associates’ sex crimes, recovered carbon copies of hand-written messages taken by various staff, including Defendant, at Epstein’s Palm Beach residence.

\- The messages raise a question of fact as to Maxwell’s involvement in the sexual abuse of minors and are relevant to refute Maxwell’s denial of any involvement with Epstein during relevant time periods, and, accordingly her denial of knowledge of certain events.

Page 280

\- Messages reveals that Maxwell, “GM,” took messages at the residence, including from underage girls who were calling to schedule a time to come over to see Epstein.

Page 282

\- One message pad reflects , who is identified in the Palm Beach Police Report as a minor, contacting Jeffrey Epstein for “work” explaining that she does not have any money. The term “work” was often used by members of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual trafficking ring to refer to sexual massages.

\- Giuffre 001462: July 5th no year to JE from ”I need work. I mean I don’t have money. Do you have some work for me?”

\- Other message pads reflect who was a minor, calling and leaving a message at the Palm Beach mansion that she has recruited another girl for Jeffrey Epstein. The second message demonstrates that Jeffrey Epstein required different girls to be scheduled every day of the week. The third shows an offer to have two minor girls come to the home at the same time to provide sexual massages. These type of messages indicate the lack of secrecy of the fact that multiple young females were visiting every day and at least raises a question of fact whether Maxwell was knowledgeable and involved as Giuffre has said, or whether Giuffre was lying and Maxwell was not at all involved or aware of this activity, as Defendant would attempt to have the world believe

\- Giuffre 001428 – undated Jeffrey From – “Has girl for tonight” ;Giuffre 001432 (pictured above)– 7/9/04 – Mr. Epstein From – “ is available on Tuesday no one for tomorrow”; GIUFFRE 001433 /1/17/04 – Mr. Epstein from – “Me and \_\_\_\_\_ can come tomorrow any time or alone” ; Giuffre – 001452 – undated Jeffrey from “Has girl for tonight.”

\- Other message pads demonstrate that there was a pattern and practice of using young females to recruit additional young females to provide sexual massages on a daily basis.

\- Giuffre 001413 (pictured above)– JE from “N” – “ hasn’t confirmed for 11:00 yet, so she is keeping on hold in case doesn’t call back; Giuffre 001448 -8/20/05 JE from - confirmed \_\_\_ at 4 pm. Who is scheduled for morning? I believe wants to work.”

\- This message pad reflects that a friend of Jeffrey Epstein is sending him a sixteen year old Russian girl for purposes of sex.

\- Giuffre 001563 (pictured above)- 6/1/05 For Jeffrey From Jean Luc “He has a teacher for you to teach you how to speak Russian. She is 2X8 years old not blonde. Lessons are free and you can have your 1st today if you call.”

Page 283

\- This message pad directly refutes Maxwell’s sworn testimony that she was not present during the year 2005 at Jeffrey Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion because this shows leaving a message for Jeffrey at the Palm Beach home that she was going to work out 30 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 28. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page28 of 74 21 with the Defendant on September 10, 2005. The police were only able to retrieve a fraction of these message pads during their trash pull but even in the few they recovered, it shows Maxwell was regularly at the Palm Beach home during the time period she claimed she was not. To the contrary, she was both sending and receiving messages and messages, like this one, reflect her presence at the mansion.

\- Giuffre 001412 – 9/10/05 (during the year Maxwell says she was never around) JE from – “I went to Sarah and made her water bottle and I went to work out with GM.”

\- These message pads further corroborate that Defendant lied in her testimony and she was in fact in regular contact with Jeffrey Epstein during the years 2004 and 2005. For example, the message from “Larry” demonstrates that Defendant is at the Palm Beach mansion so frequently that people, including Epstein’s main pilot Larry Visoski, are leaving messages for Maxwell at the Palm Beach house.

\- Giuffre 001435 7/25/04 – Mr. Epstein from Ms. Maxwell – “tell him to call me”; Giuffre – 001449 – 8/22/05 – JE from GM; Giuffre – 001453 – 4/25/04 for Ms. Maxwell From Larry “returning your call”;

\- This message pad shows that Defendant was clearly actively involved in Jeffrey Epstein’s life and the activities at his Palm Beach mansion.

\- Giuffre – 001454 – undated Jeffrey From Ghislaine – “Would be helpful to have \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ come to Palm Beach today to stay here and help train new staff with Ghislaine.”

\- This message pad clearly reflects an underage female (noted by the police redaction of the name) leaving a message asking if she can come to the house at a later time because she needs to “stay in school.”

\- ” Giuffre 001417 (pictured above)– Jeffrey 2/28/05 Redacted name “She is wondering if 2:30 is o.k. She needs to stay in school.”

\- This message pad reflects a message from who was under the age of eighteen at the time she was going over to Jeffrey Epstein’s home to provide sexual massages according to the Palm Beach Investigative Report.

\- Giuffre 001421 3/4/05 to Jeffrey from “It is o.k. for to stop by and drop something?”

\- These message pads reflect the pattern of underage girls (noted by the police redaction of the name on the message pad) calling the Palm Beach mansion to leave a message about sending a “female” over to provide a sexual massage.

\- Giuffre 001423 11/08/04 To Mr. JE – redacted from – “I have a female for him”Giuffre 001426 (pictured above) – 1/09/05 JE To JE from Redacted – “I have a female for him.”

Page 284

\- This message pad reflects the pattern and practice of having young girls bring other young girls to the house to perform sexual massages. Indeed the “ ” reflected in this message pad corresponds in name to the ” that Tony Figueroa testified he initially brought to Jeffrey Epstein during the time period that the Defendant was requesting that Tony find some young females to bring to Jeffrey Epstein’s home. See Figueroa at 184- 185. The Palm Beach Police Report reflects that “ ” and “ ” also brought seventeen year old to the home to perform sexual massages. See GIUFFRE 05641. thereafter recruited a number of other young girls to perform sexual Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page29 of 74 22 massages as reflected in the Palm Beach Police Report.

\- Giuffre 001427 (pictured above) – 1/2/03 – JE from “Wants to know if she should bring her friend with tonight.”

\- This message pad reflects multiple sexual massages being scheduled for the same day which corroborates Virginia GIUFFRE, and Johanna Sjorberg’s testimony that Jeffrey Epstein required that he have multiple orgasms in a day which occurred during these sexual massages.

\- Giuffre 001449 (pictured above) – 9/03/05 JE from – “I left message for to confirm for 11:00 a.m. and for 4:30 p.m.”

\- This message pad shows a friend of Jeffrey Epstein’s discussing with him how he had sex with an 18 year old who had also been with Jeffrey Epstein.

\- Giuffre – 001456 (pictured above)– undated JE from Jean Luc – “He just did a good one – 18 years – she spoke to me and said “I love Jeffrey.”

\- Law enforcement was able to confirm identities of underage victims through the use of the names and telephone numbers in these message pads

Page 285

**The Black Book**

\- Palm Beach Police confiscated an extensive lists of contacts with their phone numbers form Defendant and Epstein’s residence.32 Ghislaine Maxwell maintained a contact list in an 31 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 42:14-43:17; 78:25:-79:15. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page30 of 74 23 approximately 100-page-long hard copy, which was openly available to other house employees.

\- It consisted primarily of telephone numbers, addresses, or email addresses for various personal friends, associates, employees, or personal or business connections of Epstein or Defendant. Prior to being terminated by Defendant, the Palm Beach house butler Alfredo Rodriguez printed a copy of this document and ultimately provided it to the FBI.

\- This document reflects the numerous phone numbers of Defendant, Epstein as well as staff phone numbers.

\- Additionally, and importantly, there are several sections entitled “Massage” alongside a geographical designation with names of females and corresponding telephone numbers. These numbers included those of underage females (with no training in massage therapy ) – including – identified during the criminal investigation of Epstein. This document is an authentic reflection of the people who were associated with Epstein, Defendant, and the management of their properties, and the knowledge each had of the contents of the document.

**Sex Slave Amazon.com Book Receipt**

\- Detective Recarey authenticated an Amazon.com receipt that the Palm Beach Police collected from Jeffrey Epstein’s trash.

\- The books he ordered are titled:

(1) SM 101: A Realistic Introduction, Wiseman, Jay;

(2) SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for Erotic Servitude – Principles, Skills and Tools by Guy Baldwin; and 

(3) Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and Their Owners, by Christina Abernathy, as shown below: 32 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 45, Phone List, Public Records Request No.: 16-268 at 2282 – 2288. Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page31 of 74 24

\- This disturbing 2005 purchase corroborate Ms. Giuffre’s account of being sexually exploited by Defendant and Epstein – not to mention the dozens of underage girls in the Palm Beach Police Report. Additionally, Defendant testified that she was not with Jeffrey Epstein in 2005 and 2006 when he was ordering books on how to use sex slaves; however, record evidence contradicts that testimony.

Page 287

**Thailand Folder with Defendant’s Phone Number**

\- Defendant also was integral in arranging to have Virginia go to Thailand. While Epstein had paid for a massage therapy session in Thailand, there was a catch.

\- Defendant told Virginia she had to meet young girls in Thailand and bring her back to the U.S. for Epstein and Defendant.

\- Indeed, on the travel records and tickets Defendant gave to Virginia, Defendant wrote on the back the name of the girl Virginia was supposed to meet, and she was also instructed to check in frequently with Defendant as it was further signified by the words “Call Ms. Maxwell (917) !” on Virginia’s travel documents. In this case, Virginia also produced the hard copy records from her hotel stay in Thailand paid for by Epstein.

\- The FBI report and the Churcher emails reference Ms. Giuffre’s accounts of sexual activity with Prince Andrew that she made in 2011, contrary to Defendant’s argument that Ms. Giuffre never made such claims until 2014.",-7398851500755027920,1
109,mcdkwv,"Reddit has allegedly hired a pedophile sympathizer as an admin, allowed them to abuse their power to keep their name and history off Reddit, and appears to be lying to cover it up. We stand in solidarity with everyone demanding answers and accountability.","The following post comes from the mod team at r/bad_cop_no_donut “we” does not mean the moderators of this sub.

Here's a brief rundown of what is alleged with links:

* A moderator of [r/ukpolitics linked to an article from the Spectator](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/mbbm2c/welcome_back_subreddit_statement/), which ""contained a three-word mention, in passing, of a minor British public figure, expelled from both the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party"" (not knowing this was a Reddit admin)

* The moderator was permanently suspended for ""doxxing""

* That modteam later discovered that Reddit had hired this individual from the article, and therefore considered it doxxing.

* That modteam shutdown their subreddit in protest which got a lot of attention and eventually resulted in the unbanning of the moderator.

* Reddit has allegedly banned people and removed links sitewide regarding this matter.

* [Reddit responded](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/mbqgx2/a_clarification_on_actioning_and_employee_names/) by [allegedly lying about an automated process removing a link](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/mbqgx2/a_clarification_on_actioning_and_employee_names/grzjz5f/) to hide the fact that an admin removed it manually. Be sure to read the comments. They're illuminating.

-------------------------------------------

That's bad enough, but it gets worse.

* This admin is allegedly married to a literal, self-admitted pedophile who writes sex stories about kids. ([tweet](https://i.imgur.com/j2GXHtW.jpg))

* This admin allegedly hired her father as elections agent after he was charged for holding a 10 year old girl captive in his ""torture den"" where he electrocuted her while playing out his sadomasochistic fantasies (""subjected the child to a campaign of abuse which included tying her from a beam, whipping her and giving her electric shocks.""). He was later convicted and sentenced to 20 years. Please forgive me not linking or naming this person to avoid my account's termination.

* This admin started off as just a volunteer moderator for child/teen-focused subreddits before becoming a Reddit employee.

----------------------------

Since this has all gone down, subreddits across the site have gone private to demand the Reddit admins address the issue of allegedly hiring and protecting a pedophile sympathizer and enabler while abusing their own power to hide this fact.

-------------------------------------------------------

**Where do we go from here?**

Yesterday I posted a less detailed thread for a short period polling the userbase of this subreddit regarding shutting our subreddit in solidarity with the other subs. It has since been removed because it crossed the line from explaining allegations to making claims. However the initial response was seemingly unanimous and strongly in favor of shutting down.

After a lengthy discussion with u/AnnArchist, we came to the joint agreement that we would issue this statement of solidarity with the subreddits that have shut down and demand that Reddit's admins address the facts as alleged above.

Because we are not your rulers and only janitors on your behalf, with your permission we plan to wait until 3PM Eastern Daylight Time today to see if Reddit's admins address these concerns to the satisfaction of the site's moderators and our userbase. We acknowledge that context could be added and that Reddit's admins may well not have known the history of this person they hired. We don't want to disrupt the important work of this sub without good cause and prudent deliberation.

If that does not occur, assuming our userbase consents, we plan to make this subreddit private in full solidarity with the other subreddits until that condition is met.

Please feel free to give your feedback in this thread and upvote comments that represent your feelings on the matter. We will read every comment.

Thank you.

118,m92tfq,I hate that police can completely fuck up your life and there's almost nothing you can do about it,"Like there's literally nothing you can do if a police officer decides he wants to fuck with you, for whatever reason. They can, and have, arrested people for bullshit charges that dont stick. Like ""resisting arrest"", even though the victim isn't moving at all [\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/h9qvo0/officer_chocking_a_guy_for_no_reason_he_was_later/) Or because you were filming an officer, which is absolutely legal [\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/jnf0oe/nyc_journalist_arrested_for_filming_the_arrest_of/) [\[2\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/hyld6p/richmond_police_arrest_someone_for_filming_them/). Or any other reason they decide offends them. But they don't care, because they won't be punished for it. But you'll still be arrested, and have to lawyer up, and go through the whole fucking hassle.

But they have ways to make charges stick too, like planting evidence. I'm sure many are aware of the cop who was recently exposed for planting drugs in people's cars[\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/km0uev/pos_cop_planting_crack_cocaine_on_innocent_person/) [\[2\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/hdbrxp/nypd_police_plant_drugs_on_an_innocent_person). How many innocent people were arrested and charged because of this? How many continue to be today? And what recourse do we have? Body cams could potentially help, but many times officers have covered up their cams or shut them off. Again, they aren't punished for it.

Besides abusing their power to arrest, they can just beat the shit out of you, or use excessive force for whatever reason [\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/gee66j/good_ole_american_police_protecting_the_city/)[\[2\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/lrftfu/baton_rouge_police_officer_chokes_a/)[\[3\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/kvn5om/he_wasnt_even_resisting/)[\[4\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/k2araj/20_cops_v_1_dude_who_is_not_resisting/). Maybe because it makes them feel good, feel powerful. Or they like hurting people. i don't know, but I do know there's nothing we can do about, which might be the worst part. We resist, they use even greater force. We try to fight back, we'll probably be shot at and killed. Nothing we can do, beside lawyer up, but even then any money is coming from the taxpayers, and the police officers, almost never punished.

That's if we survive, of course. We've seen innocent people get murdered by police, and absolutely nothing comes of it[\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/gxhbzl/other_than_george_floyd_and_daniel_shaver_this/)[\[2\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/eqdrim/four_year_anniversary_of_daniel_shaver_murder/) If police come to your house with intent to kill you, there's nothing you can do. If you have a gun and shoot back, you'll likely be killed. Even if you are only arrested, you are absolutely fucked. You'll have a hell of a battle trying to prove your innocence for sure.

So yeah, just a few examples of the ways police can just fuck up your life, and a few video examples to go along. I could show more examples, but hyperlinking is tedious. But yeah, mostly made this post just to rant, because all the injustice makes my blood boil. And figured this sub would be a good place to vent for obvious reasons about police abusing their power.

Edit: fixed hyperlinks

Edit 2: Since some people questioning whether these incidents are widespread and systemic or just a ""few bad apples"", I've decided to list some more evidence below:

&#x200B;

>According to the 2009 NPMSRP Semi-Annual PMR (Police Misconduct Rate) report, about [1 out of every 4.7 police officers](https://www.policemisconduct.net/putting-police-misconduct-statistics-in-perspective/) will be involved in an act of misconduct. The most common form of police misconduct is excessive force, which constituted 23.8% of citizen complaints in 2010. The second most common form is sexual misconduct, with a rate of 9.3% of complaints against police. Out of this 9.3% of sexual abuse from police officers, 354 of the 618 complains were forcible non-consensual acts like sexual assault and battery. 180 sexual assault victims or 51% were minors and 49% or 174 victims were adults. Police officers took an oath to protect our rights, not violently abuse them. It’s startling that peace officers are the perpetrators of vicious and humiliating acts like these.

129,dy213h,"As the situation in Hong Kong becomes more violent, why aren't there more people talking about how important firearms are going to be?","First, this is obviously a very complicated issue. Far more complex than what we'll get into here 

I've been thinking about this a lot lately, more since talk of HK police using live ammunition. What does anyone think is going to happen here as force is escalated? It's going to be the same thing as every other scenario where people with guns tell people without guns to do a thing.

This seems like an excellent example of why it's so important to keep and maintain firearms. No one needs a high capacity magazine attached to a rifle firing a hundred 5.56mm rounds a minute... Until that's the exact firepower you suddenly must stand against.

Lastly, a question for the anti-gun lurkers here chomping at the bit to call me a tiny dicked conservatard phony tough guy: what are you going to do if a radical authoritarian takes the white house, brainwashes half the country, and refuses to step down? Law and order are temporary flukes in thousands of years of regime change and war.

Edit for some key points and common arguments: it's not just about ""muh gunz"" it's about matching force. Every person, every movement, every government has a limit to how much force they are willing to use to achieve a goal. The current paradigm in HK *radically* favors the group with better weapons. This equation can't be balanced by retweets. 

Many are pointing out that China would massacre any armed resistance. This depends on China's willingness to maintain control and ALSO depends on the protesters willingness to risk their lives. Without even basic firearms, this is a meaningless option to them. They couldn't choose that path even if it was the last path necessary. They removed it years ago and now they're stuck under Chinese boots.

The no. 1 issue over the last 8 weeks has been the cost of living crisis and energy bills. You'd think therefore that Tory members should be able to choose their leader on the basis of their policies on the cost of living crisis.

Liz Truss has spent those 8 weeks saying ""I'm not going to predict the future"" and ""We'll announce something in the Autumn"", which was a bit annoying but you think 'fair enough, they need to think this through and come up with the best policy with the autumn data in their hands'.

148,mj5jyz,Why I'm jealous of the Conservative Party as a Labour voter,"So some of this might be obvious but I feel like, as somebody who's Labour, me coming out with what I'm about to will be much more meaningful due to the recognition as a voter of Labour that what Corbyn did to the Labour Party means it probably won't ever beat the Conservative Party with Johnson as their leader.

I haven't lost faith in Starmer yet but I've cooled on him in light of poor polling. However, I'm not forgetting the fact that in the summer last year he scored poll leads, at one point had the highest net ratings of any LOTO since Blair, and he was winning in demographics in the North and so on with the competence rating.

On that basis, whilst nowadays I'd back Lisa Nandy if a leadership election was held, I'm still supporting Starmer and I still think he's miles better of a leader electorally than Corbyn ever was. And I'd still vote for him over _any_ Corbynite challenger. But if it was straight between him and Nandy then I'd go for Nandy.

I look at the Conservative Party and I literally never ever end up surprised at why they're the most successful political party in the world. Unlike Labour members, many of which are cranky Corbyn fantasisers, Tory members vote for who's best placed to win and then they rally around that leader regardless of the shade of blue.

As being seen with Starmer, and particularly on the Labour sub (which is overly representative of a bunch of loony RLB lovers and Corbyn dreamers), Labour folks are putting their arms up in rage and deliberately wanting him to lose because he happens to be a much lighter shade of red than Corbyn.

This further creates a perception in the public view of a divided party. The Conservatives don't have this perception because they compromise every single time and they reap the rewards of it, 2019 being the biggest example.

Another area that makes me jealous of the Conservative Party is the fact that they're not obsessed with issues that nobody in the general public gives a damn about. Look at 'mandatory selection' or Palestine for example, two issues which a bunch of Labour people think should be prioritised over say, I dunno, actually winning a national UK wide election.

In 2018 they waved a bunch of Palestine flags at that Labour conference. Conservatives would never do so much as to wave a flag that 1. isn't even our own, and 2. wouldn't prioritise such a tiny, miniature, careless issue. People don't care about that, they care about what happens in our country domestically, not some sixth form student protest movement idea.

And then, as I mentioned, these people also want their MPs, all of which already received their mandates from the voters that matter, the electorate, to go through a process of having to be re-elected internally as candidates to stand again. What kind of party does that to its own MPs who were literally voted in to be members of parliament??

In relation to those two things as well, Labour is overly stuffed with a bunch of woke obsessed MPs, like Dawn Butler and Abbott. And Starmer taking the knee as well wasn't a good idea in the slightest, and I bet deep down he regrets ever doing it. Butler calling the police 'racist' is something not a single Conservative MP would do, the fact I can imagine that being the case shows how much discipline and unity the Tories have that Labour desperately needs.

It's why I look at Kemi Badenoach and feel gutted that Labour doesn't have someone like that in the party. She's the complete opposite of woke and I often go back to rewatch her speech in October 2020. It's Conservative folks like her that resonate with the public, not the likes of Butler.

Labour further risks alienating the core base it already lost with woke obsessiveness, it gives off the impression that the party's own MPs hate their own country, particularly when a row broke out about having to use the union jack more, to which Clive Lewis linked it to racism and so on. As a soft left winger myself I am absolutely not with that impression myself.

I can very easily hold up the union jack and proudly present it. It's not been 'claimed' by anyone, it should be a universal thing patriotism, on all sides. But for some reason Labour MPs like Abbott and Clive think it's just a big old racist thing, which further gives the impression of Labour hating the country.

The Conservatives meanwhile don't even bat an eye at it and rightly so. Some of their MPs in the house will wear union jack masks and I don't even bat an eye at it myself, but to a lot of Labour folks on Twitter they'll screenshot it and go 'look at this silly plonker LOL!'. 

Overall, the Conservative Party under Johnson, who oozes Blair like charisma, isn't probably going to be beaten because of all of the above. Every single day I look at Tory Twitter and this subreddit and you can tell which of the parties is more stable and unified.

This sub in particular is really welcoming and friendly and I feel a lot more at home here than I ever did in the left-leaning subs, and LabourUK whilst I was still unbanned there. LabourUK is a hostile, nasty, hounding place where the tiniest mention of Starmer will get the 'kEiTh' brigade going.

Here? nobody cares about if you're Labour, Lib Dem, one nation Tory or Thatcherite Tory, you'll be welcome with open arms and you'll have tons and tons of friendly debates. 

LabourUK users post hit pieces on their own leader to the point you'd assume it wasn't even a Labour sub. You get so many of them saying 'fuck Labour, I'm gonna vote Green', 'I hope Starmer loses LOL, it'll be delightful'. It's created an aura on there where it feels like the second you mention Starmer, you'll get the majority of that sub calling him a 'cunt', (some do call him that there), etc. It feels like it's against the rules to mention his name. They hate the leader of the party the sub's based around, which in itself kinda sums up the whole issue.

They genuinely want Labour to lose and they hate Starmer despite....being on a Labour sub?

None of that would be tolerated on this sub about Johnson and why should it, given this is a Conservative sub where you're meant to be in a community with people who support the same party and leader as you, and people who're gonna work with you to win elections? 

Generally though I wish my party was more like your party. Because at the moment, whilst Starmer is definitely undertaking a Kinnock in dragging it back to a state of mind of 'win first above all,' it prioritises identity politics, wokeness, internal party democracy, etc, issues that nobody in the public gives a hoot about, whilst the Conservative Party are savvy and know how to win elections and know what issues matter to voters that'll resonate. 

Last thing I wanted to say as well is that looking at the polls, another thing that really annoys me about my party is how volatile our base is compared to the Conservative one. What kind of party base views its own leader at numbers as low as a net rating as +40 or lower? that's around the number 2019 Labour voters view Starmer at now, whereas with Conservative voters from 2019, polling suggests they favour Johnson at around 70+ to 80+, and generally they never move from that. The unity differences are literally right there. 

Labour has a horribly unloyal, volatile base, and I've said it on reddit before but I dream of having the stability and loyalty of the Conservative voter base. 

One party still has the base of a bunch of sixth form, 'tHis cOunTry iS rAciSt' lot, as well as fantasisers of the last leader and the other party has grown ups who put aside their differences and unify to win power. And for that I'm extremely jealous.",4025590084615066550,1

153,olhsuy,"LabourUK does not represent true real life Labour voters - it's the opposite, and it can only dream of being the open welcoming sub that this one is.","Sorry if this violates this sub's rules but in light of a few days ago I feel like I ought to make the point, coming straight from me as a Labour person.

LabourUK does _not_ represent Labour as a party or the voters. We couldn't be more apart. LabourUK consists of Corbyn sympathetic students and RLB voters in the 2020 leadership election who growl at the notion of wanting to make the party electable.

Labour voters like me couldn't give a hoot about Palestine (in making it a priority of issue), protesty issues or things that aren't domestic. You get a lot of that on LabourUK. I don't believe in constantly attacking my own party leader to the point I give the other party ammunition to use, like LabourUK does. 

You'd be forgiven in thinking LabourUK was an anti-Labour sub considering how often it has posts attacking Keir, mocking him for wanting to make Labour electable and just saying nonsencial shit like 'Corbyn won 40%, what has Keir ever done for us?' and 'Corbyn inspired the YOOF, Keir is turning them away!'

And as a 21 year old it also bugs me to see my age demographic be generalised as disappointed in Starmer because he's turning 'young people away'. Well, he's not turning me away and I wholeheartedly support everything he's doing to make Labour electable.

There's always a culture of 'betrayal' on LabourUK as well, that Starmer dares to drive the party away from the Corbyn years to make it electable, calling him a red Tory and all sorts. 

That subreddit has been shown to be overly represented by RLB voters and just in general young students who have a fetish for the leader who gave the party its worst loss, and students and people generally who like to say 'Blair's wins weren't that good, Corbyn's 2017 election was better than all of them COMBINED!' which in itself is such a stupid sentence I need not explain any further on it.

It's funny because Twitter Labourites and people on LabourUK have the gall to call Conservatives all sorts of names yet when I see Conservatives go on there they're always called names, downvoted, etc. Yet every Conservative I've spoken to online (entirely reddit in a nutshell), and this subreddit, are some of the nicest/the nicest, opening subreddit/people I've ever come across.

I feel more at home in this subreddit in being able to have open debates with people than I do on not just LabourUK (before I was perm banned from it a year ago) but also a few other leftie-overtaken subs. 

You guys don't attack your own leader, the Conservatives are historically united when it matters, you don't give a shot about the shade of blue, you only care about winning and that's what I want in Labour, but evidently subs like LabourUK couldn't give a hoot. They're far from representative of how Labour voters feel electorally.

I think I've said this a few times here already but I thought I'd make this one to specifically call out just how nasty, unwelcoming and hateful some of those on the Labour left, and in turn, LabourUK are. Sneering at former Labour voters (saying 'they were never Labour voters, they're brainwashed, there's no point in appealing to them because they'll never vote Labour!') and just generally having a violent viewpoint on anyone remotely to the right/any Labour moderate.

Actual Labour voters like me wish to distance ourselves from the student Momentum breeding grounds of communism that's LabourUK. Just wanted to apologise to those who might've been brigaded by some in the past few days. They're not us and never will be.

154,pk8j88,No longer a “Tory”.,"Between tax hikes & vaccine passports I am now officially politically homeless. Quite depressing when I see it as my civic duty to take part in elections and now I’d abstain. 

Tory’s can’t claim to be conservative when they go against their own ideology. 

Call these tax hikes what they are at least, they spent too much on furlough schemes and are now strapped for cash. Fuck the wasteful NHS, GP’s refusing to go back to work, countless dead and dying from missed treatments and procedures, billions of pounds wasted on management and contractors. 

Maybe came to the wrong place to vent but here I am. Anyone else feel the same?",5518160064356794240,1
155,kgl7wr,Cut up my membership card tonight,"It was the last straw for me today. 

It’s not just that I’m in a strop because I can’t have Christmas, it’s everything. It’s the complete lack of foresight. 

Of course, things can change in a pandemic, and things have to be cancelled, but we’ve been given lockdown after lockdown to save Christmas, protect the NHS, ad nauseam that are obviously proving ineffective. 

For myself as an individual with a family:

- I now cannot travel with wife and small child outside of London in a car to spend Christmas with my parents because we’ll all get new strain COVID. Despite the fact that we’ve not been anywhere at all dangerous for weeks and weeks. We’ve even had our shopping delivered.

- we have no tree, presents or food because we were expecting to be away this week. I now have to brave a supermarket with god knows how many other people who were planning to leave because we aren’t getting any delivery slots now are we?

On a national level:

- hordes have descended on London train stations to flee an incoming lockdown. What did they expect?

- travel hasn’t been banned yet and trains are still running. What did they expect?

- I actually think a majority of people have obeyed the rules, but Christmas was always a line in the sand for a lot of people. It’s all well and good saying “it’s just one year, celebrate it in March” but this week is the only week off for a lot of families and it’s not just one day is it? It’s the week.

Ceaseless lockdowns are going to cause so much more death and crisis in terms of mental health of the populace, and businesses are going to die forever. It’s all well and good to say “businesses die and that’s natural”, but most of those that die fail in competition, not because they are forced to close by governmental decree. The competition is dying too. 

First and foremost, I’m a libertarian. I saw the consequences of the announcement that Boris made this evening immediately, and I realised that I was only holding on to my party membership for the sake of a vote in a leadership election that wasn’t coming. I can’t countenance giving money to an organisation that doesn’t share my beliefs at all any more. That’s why I decided to cut up my card today.",-3661682610619376901,1

Renaming everything named after historical figures who may now be recontextualised as bad people is ridiculous. In my local area we have lots of road names named after famous historical figures. I'm sure you can find a reason to get rid of all of them under this new SJW criteria.

Clement Attlee? He was PM during empire. He's a bad person by the BLM logic then...

Florence Nightingale? [Power crazed meddler](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/sep/03/health.healthandwellbeing) and probably a racist (given the era she lived). Nope.

Shall we go for a Soviet approach. Street A, Street B, Street C, etc. I'm sure someone could find a problem with that. Why are we using the Latin alphabet? That discriminates against other alphabetic systems.

It often feels like these people seek to be offended now. It's honestly crazy. A lot of people engaged in these sorts of extreme views online are university students. I feel it's a bit of an ego stroke. ""I'm so smart!"" ""Look how left wing I am!"" I've seen people posting about BLM getting abused for not going far enough with their tweets in support.

I am tired of the virtue signalling SJW. Sorry to use those buzzwords but it's easiest to describe.

I am a centrist. I have no extreme views. I believe George Floyd's murder was unjust but these people are using it to advance aims beyond police brutality.

Having been both Labour and Conservative in the past, he could understand both sides and attract voters from across the isle. You'd only have to listen to him speak, and it's clear that he isn't repeating rehearsed replies or winging some BS reply.

I'd never leave to go abroad and even when I went on holiday as recently as 2019 I felt gloomy and out of place because I wasn't in Britain. I think I even subtly cried at one point.

I love our culture, I feel more British than I do Welsh, as someone who lives in Wales. And that's why I, when I go shopping now, I wear a union jack face mask.

Am I embarrassed by it? not a chance. Would I hang a union jack off the house if I could? absolutely. Because not only do I believe in the union but I'm also really grateful and proud to be living in this country. We have such a great culture, our jokes, the services we have access to, the food, just everything. I'd never move to America or anywhere abroad. I'll be staying here forever.

To make it probably even more rarer I'm a 21 year old. It's probably unheard of for a 21 year old to be patriotic to the extent I am where I'm walking around with the flag on my face in shops.

From my perspective ultimately it's disheartening that my own party has to have a debate about patriotism and not just automatically adopt it because of some cranky Corbynites who're obsessive over Palestine or whatever. 

The Conservative logo has the union jack, 95% of their people are patriotic and it's evident to the voters, the Labour Party is at best 50% patriotic or slightly less.

Has anyone known anyone else of my age group to be patriotic because I genuinely feel like I'm a rare type. But that'll never stop me from feeling proud of the country I'm more than happy to live in.

My own story is that I'm from a very typical working class, Labour supporting family (so much so, my grandad was a unionist).

Over the years, I've drifted from Labour when I was a teen, to Lib Dem in my 20s and finally Tory on my 30s. When the coalition government began, I voted for Clegg at the start in 2010 and in the years between then and 2015, I realized I preferred Tory policies and really liked Cameron as a politician. I found I was flourishing both financially and professionally, and felt I had nothing in common with Labour ideals. I had a blip when Theresa May was in charge (I really didn't like her as PM) but started to be won over by Boris and the manifesto so I voted Tory and then joined the party properly. I've even won my mum and dad over, they voted Tory too (which is no easy feat for my dad, he's been a Labour man for nearly 50 years).

I’m extremely pro deal and desperately want a free trade agreement, but point 2 and point 3 are absolutely unacceptable, and it seems specifically designed so that the British will reject it.

ITV news even have the emails which prove the existence of the party taking place in the Downing Street garden.
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-59930733

First of all it's completely disrespectful for a Prime Minister and those in positions of power to throw a party while the nation is in lockdown which completely banned people from seeing family and unable to give their loved ones a dignified goodbye because of funeral restrictions in place during lockdown. It is not fair that the people in authority expect and demand the British public take seriously the rules and public health measures in place however those in authority are breaking their own rules. 

The British media and journalists I am sorry to say are full sh*t as well. The media fully knew all these parties in Downing Street were happening however they constantly demonised and publicly shamed young people for having university house parties, raves and having gatherings with friends.  The media knew about the 2020 Christmas office party in Downing Street however sat on the story for a year while the public had to spend the Christmas season being told not household mix. I couldn't stop laughing when sky news was covering the story about the Downing Street Christmas party. The same month that Downing Street Christmas office party took place was the same month when Sky news presenter Kay Burley had a birthday party which broke lockdown rules. Kay Burley, Beth Rigby and their other colleagues who attended got suspended from Sky News. Now this is the same channel preaching about the Prime Ministers wrong doing but their staff are engaging in the same sin and law breaking. What the Prime Minister did was 100% wrong but the media complicity and covering up of it is just as bad. The British public were furious about the party however I was furious about the media not reporting it at the time and waiting a full year. Remember Neil Ferguson when he saw his girlfriend during the 1st lockdown the British media knew about the affair however didn't report months later.

This new revelation about the Downing Street garden which over 100 people attended there was absolutely no way the British media didn't know about the party. The British media and politicians are very close knit clique of friendship which politicians are close friends with journalists in the main news outlets in the UK. They all knew. 

I feel like the British public we are being mocked by the elite and those in positions of authority. I supported the first lockdown because I was scared the NHS wouldn't cope and feared it would collapse. The NHS struggles with Winter flu there was no way the nhs would cope with a tsunami of covid19 cases. I stopped supporting lockdowns because of the hypocrisy from politicians and people in authority. Its not fair it one rule for us but a different rule for them.  This gathering is symbolic in itself. The gathering is symbolic of the Prime Ministers contempt of the British public. This gathering reveals Boris Johnsons real nature which is he holds to contempt the British public who elected him and he believes the rules he made does not apply to him. This pure corruption of power. 

Tories how do you feel about the Downing Street garden party revelation? I am disgusted and I think Boris needs to resign because this is pure contempt for the British public who sacrificed so much to ensure these rules were adhered to and public health protected.

Personally, I will not be voting for him/the Conservative party if he becomes leader. I will likely spoil my ballot. I am a lifelong Tory voter but I am not comfortable having an ex-Goldman man and husband to the daughter of an Indian billionaire in no.10. To me, he represents everything wrong with global elitism. He's a Macron - he represents the champagne drinking bankers who laughed at the protestors below from their balconies on Wall Street in 2008. He doesn't even come with a wealth of ministerial experience, either. He is too polished.

I want someone from the aspirational classes with a Conservative outlook. Someone who supports a smaller state, lower taxes, NHS reform, strong community spirit, family values and associated higher birth rates - an end of Wokeism.

It's a hard ask, I know. For me though, aspiration and personal responsibility is what Conservatism is all about. Those that have 'broken through' should be brought to the fore. A greengrocer's daughter is fine by me.

Good morning folks,

I hope you're all doing well.

I've been trying to understand different people's points of view about the Conservative party since Boris Johnson's premiership, particularly with Covid-19.

For context, I have a very negative view of this current government. Nightingale hospitals completely empty because staffing and logistics weren't considered. £22bn set aside to an ineffective company with no previous experience of contact tracing, money that the taxpayer will have to pay back. A lackadaisical approach to handling this pandemic, that has seen countless jobs, businesses and livelihoods destroyed, while COVID hospital admissions and deaths are at the highest this nation has ever seen. 

My current opinion is that this party is an embarrassment to conservatives, which I understand is a very one-sided view. This is why I would like to ask other people for different points-of-view, so that I can have a more rounded perception of the Tories.

What are your opinions on the Conservative handling of the pandemic? Do you believe that they've done badly, or that they've done as well as they can given the circumstances?",4693776429329086657,1

Look on my post history and you'll see I tend to post on the Scottish sub. I post in good faith because I wanna debate with Scottish Nationalists and just generally get wide ranging views in that sub. I'm a unionist.

But everytime I do, I'm met with full on abuse, I've been sworn at etc, I even had a guy on there tell me to go back to 'shagging sheep' because I was born in Wales etc, and I've pretty much developed a bad reputation there for.....having a different view?

I've never thrown the verbal abuse back, I've not acknowledged it but every single comment I've made on that sub, they get downvoted to oblivion and it's just generally a swarm of SNP/Sturgeon lovers doing as much as possible to bring someone down mentally etc, which it hasn't, but it does stick.

As Conservatives do you tend to hide your unionism on the basis of the above? I know it's only a reddit sub but still, it exposes just how toxic and nasty the SNP's supporters are, and I know for a fact they don't represent Scotland in their tone etc. 

Hell, I'm a bloody Labour unionist and I'm treated like a nazi, so I can imagine why Scottish Conservatives, for those here, would hide their views, you'd be barracked. That's what unionism is up against but I think the polls, showing no in the lead constantly as of late, possibly point to possible victory for the cause if their momentum keeps dropping.

People's needs change with time. Social Housing, by very definition, is for those ""most in need"". But if their needs change, why doesn't their entitlement? For instance, we have a mass of older parents in the UK currently occupying social housing because at the time it was allocated they had a family to raise. Those children have now flown the nest (sometimes multiple generations ago) yet they rattle around in 3 or 4 bedroom houses. Why? 

My own Nan is implicit in this. She lives in a 3 bed semi detached house near a primary school. The council have stumped the cash to install a stairlift, completely adapt the bathroom for grabrails etc, all the while this poor woman can't even clean said house, it's too much work. There's a driveway and two large gardens, none of which she can maintain. I've spoken to her about moving to assisted living accommodation which she's open to, but has no understanding of how to ask about it through the council.

Then it comes to winter. Media circus makes a big deal about how the elderly will suffer more / be worse off every winter. So we subsidise their bills, just as we are subsidising the very property they live in. It's expensive to heat a massive house, it's absolutely insane to heat a massive house for a single occupant?

I'm prompted to write this because just now the council houses in my street are being decked out with new double glazing in time for winter. That means the drug addict next door but one can at least remain warm when he's next beating up his wife. 

Why is there no policy to means test every 5, 10 years? It's a fallacy. All the while there's a housing crisis we have things back-to-front. Those young families are living in new-build rabbit hutch estates without enough parking, in tiny homes which are super efficient and cost effective to heat. Then we have old single people occupying massive family homes which they cannot heat or maintain.

241,gaqkv6,TOM HARWOOD: The BBC's unforgivably Trot-dominated Panorama shows why we need transparency," 

TOM HARWOOD  Daily Telegraph

29 APRIL 2020 • 11:27AM

The BBC’s Panorama programme this week was a disaster. What could have  been an enlightening insight into the genuine NHS front line and the  undoubtable problems that a pandemic throws up instead descended into  attempted hatchet job that ignored all perspectives but one – that of  its hyper-partisan line up of interviewees.

Research from Guido  Fawkes yesterday remarkably revealed that every single doctor  interviewed for Panorama had a history of left-wing political activism.  The Labour Party links were so deep that the programme turned into more  of a Party Political Broadcast than a piece of serious journalism. It  even shared the same cast as one, as Panorama’s trainee GP (and wannabe  MP) Sonia Adesara genuinely appeared in the Labour’s 2019 TV adverts.

 Instead of representing a range of voices, the critiques that certainly  exist from the pro-market perspectives were simply ignored. Panorama  instead favoured highlighting the views of longstanding far left members  of the Labour party, union organisers, and even candidates. To cap it  all off, none were flagged up as such to the audience by the BBC,  directly breaching the organisation’s code of conduct commitment to  disclose what the Beeb calls ‘Contributors’ Affiliations’.

It  would have been about as appropriate to have interviewed Tory MP Dr Luke  Evans on NHS sentiment towards the government as it was for Panorama to  showcase this cabal of Corbynites.

Undoubtedly, many NHS workers  are concerned. It would be worrying if they weren’t at a time such as  this. What is less clear is the idea that they heap political blame on  the Tories in the same way that Panorama’s tiresome troop of Trots tried  to. If there genuinely is widespread anti-Tory sentiment in NHS ranks  as a result of coronavirus, it should have been easy enough to find  someone among the majority of doctors who are not party political  activists to say that.

Interviewee-rigging undermines the programme’s own case.

 Examining the remarkable list of medics given the spotlight up you  would be forgiven for thinking that the entire health service was  staffed exclusively by Tory-bashing, Corbyn loving, political  headbangers. You would be shocked to discover that in fact survey after  survey finds that fewer than half of medical professionals support the  Labour Party, and of the ten doctors elected to parliament in the last  election, eight were Conservatives.

This debacle, however, is not  the first time a broadcaster has fallen foul of its duty to keep  viewers informed. Recently the BBC interviewed GP Dr Paul Williams on a  ‘Your Questions Answered’ news broadcast, where he proceeded to attack  the Government. The catch? Dr Williams was a Labour MP until 2019 and is  currently standing to become a Labour Police and Crime Commissioner.  Not that the viewers were told.

Nor were BBC viewers informed  about the political background of the ‘A&E Nurse’ who turned out to  be a Unite activist who “fights the Tories hard”, or Professor John  Ashton (also featured in the Panorama disaster), who proudly described  himself as a Labour Party member “for 53 years”.

The argument  here is not that television programmes have no right to interview  partisan guests – of course they do. News with views is in many ways a  more honest and healthy way to conduct a political conversation than the  faux-impartiality half-heartedly pursued by so many of our  broadcasters. The point is not to shut things down but open them up.  Audiences have a right to know, and broadcasters have a duty to say, who  their ‘experts’ really are.

While trust in every other  profession has risen, confidence in the media has collapsed over the  last month. With egregious errors of judgement like these, it’s easy to  see why. It’s clear that things need to change. Transparency has to  increase.""",-1030465334628276851,1

243,n6rqjg,Why I think Labour are failing,"Labour, the traditional party of the working class began to lose its way during the Blair years with its lurch to the centre ground, it ultimately eroded the principals which made Labour politicians, people one could respect and admire, even if one profoundly disagreed with them. Then came the post-Blair years and the even more seismic lurch to the far left. The Corbyn regime never really had a chance of being elected; the British had fought a 40 year Cold War so it is unsurprising that they wouldn’t elect an avowed Marxist. None of these though are the reasons why I genuinely don’t see Labour as having much chance of being elected in the next few decades. The real reason, as I see it is the disenfranchisement of its candidates from the people and areas they represent. The Conservatives have had remarkable success in making candidates out of local people who actually fight for their constituents and are visible in their local communities. Labour on the other hand have shifted to pandering to what they now see as their core vote; namely, young people in metropolitan areas. Gone are the days when Labour fought for workers rights in places like Hartlepool with conviction and because they actually cared. I hate the term “wokeism”, but the reality is that this kind of student politics is now an issue for what they see as their core vote. The shame at being British and willingness to support  the EU over Britain also did them no favours. Of course, to their old voter base, namely, the working class; things such as wokeism and being unpatriotic are an anathema. Sadly for Labour, their old core vote represented a huge part of the population and was scattered throughout the country, giving them far more chance of winning elections because they could win more seats. Their new core vote however is centred around urban centres; they will always win in places like Manchester and areas of London but this will never be enough to win an election.



Frankly, it is sad to see such a venerable old party sink so low. By swapping one core vote for another, they have lost their raison d'etre. Working class voters now see the Conservatives as their party of choice (who’d have thunk it). As I see it, Labour will never be an electable force again unless it shakes off its image as a Britain hating, wokeist and race bating party playing student politics. It must embrace Brexit and stop thinking it knows better than the voters (see Starmer not taking lectures from pub landlords). It needs to find more Kate Honey’ s and fewer Angela Rainers.



Until it realises that it has become a niche party, pandering to a tiny minority, it will continue to be an irrelevance and a sad footnote in British politics.",-1466228705048552962,1

254,x1uswg,The Great British Depression,"15 years ago, £1.00 equalled US$2.02. 15 years years ago, our economic activity matched a trend line set for the past 50 years. We grew at an average rate of 2.7%, we're now way below that trend on 1.7%, and this is getting even worse. 15 years ago, our GDP per capita was higher than the US's. 15 years ago, our debt to GDP ratio was 41%, not the 100-ish% we have today. 15 years ago, real wages did not stagnate. 15 years ago, we had a legitimate reason to save money as the rates weren't piss poor (5.75%). Then there is inflation, clearly far worse than in 2007. Yet, we do currently have high employment. Well, these jobs are poor quality as our worker productivity is a shambles, and if these jobs were so great, we'd have the economic activity / real wages to match. Yes, the 2008 crisis hit hard, but surely after 15 years, we should have recovered, but instead, we're still in the same quicksand, slowly sinking. We've been in a depression, but no one really talks about it or will rarely admit it.

So what is the cure for this? Is it Liz Truss's economic plans? Do they inspire you to think that she can halt this decline and bring about prosperity? Or perhaps you feel she has simply put on a Tories' Greatest Hits album and is hoping that that'll do the job? I was pleased to hear she said they should be a party focusing on economic growth, but to me, it was far too little, too late. Unless they go hard on the real potential drivers of economic growth (cost-effective energy, SMEs, getting liquidity into the system for SMEs, trade, manufacturing advanced goods, making sure advanced and big British companies stay British and aren't gutted by hedge funds or by anti-competitive big tech firms, put big capital behind big British firms that actually make things, fintech, blockchain, long-term economic planning etc), I feel we might just end up in the gutter.

258,e4ya60,[Serious] When did CCHQ turn into such a solid bed of... ?,"I've voted Conservative in every GE since I turned 18. I've talked to my MPs. My outgoing MP was a solid chap who represented me well. But this year I *just can't.*

I won't be voting Labour - obviously. Even though some of their policies are appealing, I have no faith in a Corbyn-Abbott administration to deliver and in any case other policies cross red lines for me.

In principle, this should be a pretty straightforward win for the Conservatives. All they have to do is show a bit of post-austerity generosity, play to the usual strengths and put down Corbyn.

But no. Instead, we have been subjected to a smorgasboard of disingenuous and brazen (mis-)conduct. We had the shenanigans with ""FactCheckUK"" during the C4 debate, promoting the fake ""labourmanifesto.co.uk"" to the top of Google and a plethora of other *bullshit* which suggests that Steve Bannon and Trump are running CCHQ's campaign. Boris couldn't be bothered to turn up to the Climate Debate, which could have been an opportunity to turn a weakness around and is playing silly buggers over being interviewed by Andrew Neil - what's he so afraid of? That Corbyn might out-perform him? Really?

When did American electioneering become the standard over here? We don't want it, and it needs to flock off.

Don't get me wrong. Political campaigns have always had an edge - selective facts, lying-by-omission, overly ambitious manifesto pledges - but CCHQ seem to have sought a new level this election by wholeheartedly embracing a post-truth mindset and deciding ""if they're going to call us the nasty party, then we're going to *be* the nasty party"".

It's a whole new level of brazen bullshit which I can't help but find reprehensible. I can't vote for that. I can't condone or reward such conduct, and it seems [I'm not the only one feeling this way](https://www.reddit.com/r/tories/comments/e3g0se/i_fear_the_tories_may_yet_blow_this_election/).

And I can't even tell myself I'm just voting for the local candidate, because she's the niece of bloody Mogg.

What's a moderate, reluctant-Leave small-c conservative to do?

* Don't like Labour
* Can't in good conscience vote for the Conservatives.
* Disagree with the implementation of most Green policies (though not the intent)

Which leaves hard-Remain LibDems who (on some issues) I can sort of work with in principle, but they're really not selling themselves to me very well this time round and I am still tentatively Leave (if only to prove it can be done - nothing is forever, not even the EU).

Why can't the Conservatives do what they're good at? Fiscally sensible, pragmatic policies free of over-bearing ideologies. When did they decide to go full GOP?

259,o9qzu9,Why do you think Conservatives have such a low presence online?,"When I say conservatives I refer to anyone that has Conservative views not just the Conservative party in the UK

Reason I bring this up is because over the past year I've been red pilled and seen just how much of social media is flooded with lefties,

Subreddit after subreddit is filled with them for example r/Scotland (basically r/snp at this point) as you might well expect is rife with them amongst various other subreddits you post anything there that isn't progressive or something that's  moderate you get piled on and downvoted into the ground its ironic that they want to encourage/promote diversity and inclusion except when it comes to diversity of thought
From what I've seen logic and facts are dismissed for emotions most of the time 
 
These subs are massive compared to subreddits full of  conservative  
 
My question to you is do you feel a lot of conservatives just don't use social media platforms or do you feel we are being suppressed via social media pile ons and shaming for daring to have different views on issues which

One thing that is really bothering to me aswell and I don't know how much this sentiment is shared (it will probably vary wildly on the area) is the social stigma and shame the left put on us for having different  stances on issues. in Glasgow there's a herd mentality when it comes to the tories they just have this idea if you vote tory your a bad person or as they like to put it ""a cunt"" and the notorious annual election post of ""if you voted tory unfriend me""",4744139538484730158,1

261,sdyq9i,My problem with Thatcherism.,"So I often hear conservatives, both small C and big C, saying that what Britain needs is another Thatcher and how she was so brilliant for the country and for the conservative movement. And yes, she did a lot of good, but we don't need another one and here is my take as to why and what my problem is with Thatcherism.

I can recognise that Thatcher was good for the economy and that she won us the Falklands, but Thatcherism convinced a generation of conservatives that culture isn't relevant. This resulted in a generation of conservatives to surrender culture and society to the left. These conservatives essentially flogged off the nation's traditional culture to those who wished to destroy it.

Despite being socially conservative herself, she morphed conservatism into a movement that puts a hyper focus on economics over culture. She convinced a generation that all you have to do to conserve the culture is keep the corporate tax rate low, and while she did this a small group of people took charge of every major institution and are now pushing a further degeneration of culture. None of this would be possible had conservatives had kept culture the primary focus of the movement.

The same thing happened in the US with Reaganism. Once again, the focus shifted from conserving your culture and tradition to tax cuts and grovelling at the feet of corporations (who then turn around and push wokeism themselves).

Blairism is essentially an expansion of Thatcherism, in which the left accepted the new status quo on economics whilst changing society and culture for the worse, and Conservatives have failed to stop or oppose it because they are too focused on simply keeping the corporate tax low instead of actually going to fight for tradition, outside of virtue signalling by flag waving or what have you.",-707040025430498242,1

265,r45a2s,Why I Will Be Leaving The Conservative Party,"As of the restrictions brought back in now, particularly that of isolation even for those who are vaccinated, it has made me think about the country and what I want from it. In my belief, the government has overstepped the mark, brought back in isolation for the vaccinated through the backdoor, and haven't had the backbone to tell the country about it in the spotlight. 

I am not paying my membership fee to be limited and trapped inside when I don't have the virus. I'm not going to sit here, having had my vaccines, (done my bit, or whatever phrase they use!), only to be told that they will screw me over and make me isolate anyway when I don't have the virus. I'm not going to fund and support a power-happy man-child, who continues to claim he is a liberation, despite continuing to rob us of our freedoms. I hope they buy Boris a dictionary with my last membership fee money so he can look up what that really means!

This government promised so much in 2019, but they have been a total let down. When I see states like Florida, which have been open for longer than us and aren't bringing back any restrictions, and their case rate is better than us, I really do wonder what ""science"" we are following. Florida have six cases of covid in every 100,000 people, while we have 1 in 150, despite more restrictions. 

This government are happy to rob children of their educations, screw over small businesses with no foreseeable ending and control our lives with no proper mandate to whatsoever. 

I am deeply saddened with the direction the party is going in, and more broadly the way the country is being taken in with it. 

With deep sadness and regret I will not be renewing my membership in January, and I urge you to consider the same when your time comes.",8795340433800,1
266,cklz9o,Tax cuts for the wealthy right now is bonkers,"IMF STUDY "" The study results suggest that raising incomes for the poor and middle class yields measurable improvements to the national economy: Increasing the income share to the bottom 20 percent of citizens by a mere one percent results in a 0.38 percentage point jump in GDP growth. By contrast, increasing the income share of the top 20 percent of citizens yields a decline in GDP growth by 0.08 percentage points."" 

So, given Brexit is going to damage the economy, surely a tax cut or other benefit to the bottom earners makes far more sense right now.

If you question the logic of the report, I think basically if you have little money, any more money you get you instantly spend - hence boosting the economy.  If you are well off any more money you have you save or invest - which doesn't do boost the economy.

267,wk7xsy,Moving Utilities into Public Ownership,"I'm not remotely the sort to advocate public ownership of anything. Never have.

I've just finished paying British Gas a Bill that was 2 weeks old after they lost my account (my previous supplier went under and BG lost my account for months). 

They put the charges on quietly, they didn't show on any type of bill. They were ""added to the meter"" (I'm on a direct debit not a pay as you go meter or anything). The call centre staff either didn't understand or were under instructions to keep the charges as quiet as possible.and avoid talking about it at all cost. I went through 3 advisors before I got to the bottom of it. 

They're basically charging 3X the previous value on a product that hasn't yet gone up that amount in price and loving life as they seemingly come up with new ways to trap ordinary middle class families in debt cycles. The price is the same everywhere, the only way they get guarantee a retained customer is to put them into debt so they can refuse new suppliers.

270,ehnm7d,What's the problem with High Toryism?,"I am inspired to ask after reading this recent thread [The Conservatives need to focus on actually conserving again](https://www.reddit.com/r/tories/comments/egtyce/the_conservatives_need_to_focus_on_actually/).

High Toryism seems to be much maligned on this sub (just do a search of High Tory and see) and I often think the ideology is so misunderstood. It doesn't help that people like MasterBrew have kind of hijacked the ideology and made memes that misconstrue it. As much as I love Mrs Thatcher, I think High Tories are the only Tories that are focused on actually conserving something that isn't the budget or the economy. I argue that this form of conservatism is actually more ""caring and compassionate"" than the current strain popular in the party. 

So I'd like to clarify some of the principles of this ideology. (Some of it is taken off Wikipedia and some from Prof Ron Dart, a Canadian High Tory)

1. High Tories generally believe in noblesse oblige and their self-imposed sense of duty and responsibility to all of society, including the lower classes. 

2. They reject the values of the modern commercial business class which they see as a pursuit of individualistic, unchecked greed that destroys a sense of community and holds no regard for religious or high cultural values. 

3. They respect the environment and natural world, even at the expense of profit.

4.  A High Tory also favours a strong community in contrast to neoliberal individualism and is interested in the common good. 

5.  High Toryism is based on high ethical principle and religion (especially Anglican Christianity)

6. They see wisdom in tradition.

7. High Tories insist that the state and society work together, rather than opposing each other (as in the liberal tradition).

8. A ""High Tory"" must have an appreciation of religion and high culture. 


In sum, I really don't think being a High Tory is what you think it means. Far from being more to the right, it is in many respects more to the left actually. As another poster here said, ""There's so much more to conservatism than being keen on free markets and small government."" I think High Toryism recognises that best. I think it also may take the edge off the idea that Tories are the ""nasty"" or ""kill the poor"" party.",1552931157612761466,1

""While the rule on hate protects [marginalized or vulnerable] groups, it does not protect all groups or all forms of identity. For example, the rule does protect groups of people who are in the majority or who promote such attacks of hate."" 

Since when is so called ""hate speech"" limited only to marginalized groups? I understand that some groups are more vulnerable, but ALL groups can be targets of hate.

Edit 3: Yes, I saw the videos- I felt they were missing context. That context was explained in court, and I see where I was wrong.  
Everyone is asking why I believed Kyle was in the wrong here:
I felt that he put himself in a situation that he wasn't prepared for,  with a rifle he didn't legally aquire. From my perspective, that looked an awful lot like someone who went to a riot *looking* for an opportunity to use the gun.  The reality is that,  while I think he shouldn't have been there,  the asshole he killed was following him around harassing and threatening him.  I can't fault Kyle for defending himself, and its not my place to determine his motives. Hope that makes sense. I understand from talking with some of you here that Kyle was there to protect his community, and I can accept that his motives were good, though ill advised IMO.

China is a ruthless, power hungry dictatorship that wants to assert world domination through ways such as political influence, information warfare and economic power. Don’t believe me? Look at Africa and how they need to listen to the whims of ccp because the ccp lends them a lot of money to build infrastructures. As a result the chinese pretty much have full political and economical control as for now. 



What does that have to for the US? Well as you may heard many liberals are still hanging on the the idea of”China is our friend” or “Don’t hate china for the virus!” Truth is if you dont do something against China, they will have more and more political influence in the world and in the end you (no matter liberals/conservatives) will bow to China. Just look at how China has already influenced UK with the 5G networking deals and notice how the UK governent is so scared to say out anything agaist China (eg.the virus). Id say this to the liberals but they seemed to be too occupied with making friends with China and not even relising their freedom of speech they so enjoy will be taken away under China, China will use freedom of speech for its advantage and paint itself a good image. Just look at how many state run medias are broadcasting chinese propoganda on youtube already and how internet army speaks out against freedom fighters in HK and Tibet and of course Taiwan. They also seemed to be too occupied to say that saying out anything against China is RACIST. 


Please, for the love of god be VERY clear a dictatorship like china is your enemy and you should at least try to convince the libs to be wary. And tell them Trump is the first president to really stood up agaist China, just look what obama did to make the evil ccp a world power.

The bankers gamble people's life saving and we are told to suck it up if they lose our retirement fund. However when we make money off the Bankers, we are told that regulation is needed, bailouts need to happen, and trading needs to be stopped for market correction. This is capitalism fighting against, what Rothbard called it, the Big Business-State axis of evil. 

At this point Sacking Wall Street is acceptable within the NAP to recover stolen property that was given to them via bailouts.",-4042455310302408237,1

291,6csnow,"I used to be an Ancap, but my job made me turn to socialism.","When I first became an Ancap, I was just an unemployed high schooler who had never worked a labor job in his entire life. I had that whole ""welfare recipients are parasites, just pull yourself up by your bootstraps, forcing people to subsidize your shitty life choices is morally wrong, nobody is entitled to anything they don't own"" mentality, but then my parents made me get a job.

For the most part, I still kept my same views. My job was still pretty much Voluntary, I could quit and it would only disappoint my parents. But come this year, when I graduated high school, it began to sink in that I'm going to have to keep doing this, or God willing some other job, for the majority of my life if I want to have access to basic necessities, like food, water, shelter, etc.

I work at a grocery store, and it's usually a comfy job. Comfy enough that I was able to sincerely hold on to my Ancap beliefs, until today. Today, a line was crossed that made me see the error of my ways.

They were doing inventory, and they needed us, or more specifically, me alone to push all the items in every shelf in the entire store all the way back, and then dust the shelf off.

At first it didn't seem all that bad, but then I realized I was the only one doing it, and I would have to spend the rest of my shift on this. After only about five minutes, I felt like I was going crazy. 

Push, spray, dust, move down, push, spray dust, move down, push spray, dust, move down, push, spray dust, move slightly to the left, and repeat.

I had to do that at least 30 times to only get one side of one aisle done. Took me at least half an hour to do that, and there were still 20 more aisles left in the store. The repetitive motion, the maddeningly slow progress, and being alone for the entire 8 hour shift (including an hour of overtime) was exhausting in every way imaginable.

By the time I was done, I was infuriated, not just with the fact that I had to do this, but because of how little I got out of it. $9.30 / hour of that insanity? What kind of heartless monster would tell someone in severe poverty doing this kind of work, to just ""pull himself up by his bootstraps""? A sociopath, that's who.

I finally understood what socialists have been talking about all this time.

292,t4j7vh,Just got a warning message from a reddit admin saying that this subreddit is spreading hate,"They then linked me to 4 examples:

I will describe them rather than link to them so as to not spread more ""hate:""

* Two comments wherein users called people they were arguing with a r\*\*\*\*d (pejorative for mentally delayed person). (I really don't want to do it, but it looks like we're going to have to add another word to the world filter?)
* A meme of Trudeau as a Simpson's character where he's asking himself ""Am I out of touch?"", then him with blackface saying ""No, it's the truckers who are racist."" Apparently ridiculing public figures for acting racist is racist?
* A comment where, after a disagreeing about taxation and roads, the user called the other user a 'drooling ape' to insult their intelligence. (The admins thinking this had anything to do with hate speech is racist itself, not the comment.)

303,jp8ljg,Did they not talk about postal voting favouring Biden in America pre-election?,"I’m Australian and In the lead up to the election all the news constantly mentioned that there would be an initial red wave and then a blue wave as the postal votes were counted. It was explained that trump supporters vote on the day, Biden supporters were told to vote through mail, obviously due to covid there would be a lot of postal votes which take longer to be verified and processed. It was explained that some swing states would take longer due to their local laws, not allowing processing until the day of the election. On the day this exact thing happened and no one here was surprised. As postal votes were counted the blue wave swung to Biden, the states with the day of counting laws are the ones taking the longest. 

Because it’s so close I don’t mind people saying they should recount for accuracy but why are so many of the pro trump comments not understanding that the blue wave postal voting would swing the tide to Biden later on? Why would that mean fraud? Why are there so many comments that votes shouldn’t be counted after the day, when this is something that has always happened and been fine? Why are people questioning why these swing states are taking so long when we know that they have different processing laws to other states? Did the news not mention that this would happen before the election? 

The fact that trump was constantly saying that there would be voter fraud in postal votes way before the election kind of shows that he was going to use it as an excuse as it was well founded that postal votes would take longer and would favour Biden. It’s not like the accusation came out of nowhere, he was always going to call it, so just agreeing with him isn’t enough. I don’t think either candidate is great but seeing it all as a third party it seems so logical how the votes swayed. 

I don’t want to talk about if you think it was fraud or not, that conversation is going nowhere. I just want to know if the media explained that this would happen before the election. Even if you don’t believe the media, you can surely understand the words from both candidates mouths, trump said to vote on the day, Biden said to vote by mail as he pushes the covid threat angle.

Capitalist hegemony has short-circuited people into buying wildly illogical and ridiculous propaganda like: ""*Lift yourselves up by the bootstraps*"" (which shows the almost religious power of capitalist propaganda, that the impossible can become possible), or ""*Communism doesn't work*"", when in fact **Communism did work extremely well.**

- [Had near zero unemployment, continuous economic growth for 70 straight years.](https://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/~syrbe/pubs/FarmtoFactory.pdf) The ""continuous"" part should make sense – the USSR was a planned, non-market economy, so market crashes á la capitalism were pretty much impossible.

- Housing was socialized by localized community organizations, and there was virtually no homelessness. Houses were often shared by two families throughout the 20s and 30s – so unlike capitalism, there were no empty houses, but the houses were very full. In the 40s there was the war, and in the 50s there were a number of orphans from the war. The mass housing projects began in the 60s, they were completed in the 70s, and by the 70s, there were homeless people, but they often had genuine issues with mental health.

When it is claimed that a system *works*, we should ask, **who it works for**. Capitalism benefits a tiny number of rapacious capitalists, to the detriment of the rest of us, while Socialism works for the masses.

314,do57z4,"""Overpopulation"" is Scientific Racism: A child born in the US will create 13 times as much ecological damage over their lifetime than a child in Brazil, the average American drains as many resources as 35 natives of India and consumes 53 times more goods and services than someone from China"".","It is well known that Americans consume far more natural resources and live much less sustainably than people from any other large country of the world. “A child born in the United States will create thirteen times as much ecological damage over the course of his or her lifetime than a child born in Brazil,” reports the Sierra Club’s Dave Tilford, adding that the average American will drain as many resources as 35 natives of India and consume 53 times more goods and services than someone from China.

Tilford cites a litany of sobering statistics showing just how profligate Americans have been in using and abusing natural resources. For example, between 1900 and 1989 U.S. population tripled while its use of raw materials grew by a factor of 17.  **“With less than 5 percent of world population, the U.S. uses one-third of the world’s paper, a quarter of the world’s oil, 23 percent of the coal, 27 percent of the aluminum, and 19 percent of the copper,” he reports. “Our per capita use of energy, metals, minerals, forest products, fish, grains, meat, and even fresh water dwarfs that of people living in the developing world.”**

He adds that the U.S. ranks highest in most consumer categories by a considerable margin, even among industrial nations. **To wit, American fossil fuel consumption is double that of the average resident of Great Britain and two and a half times that of the average Japanese. Meanwhile, Americans account for only five percent of the world’s population but create half of the globe’s solid waste.**

Americans’ love of the private automobile constitutes a large part of their poor ranking. **The National Geographic Society’s annual Greendex analysis of global consumption habits finds that Americans are least likely of all people to use public transportation—only seven percent make use of transit options for daily commuting. Likewise, only one in three Americans walks or bikes to their destinations, as opposed to three-quarters of Chinese**. While China is becoming the world’s leader in total consumption of some commodities (coal, copper, etc.), the **U.S. remains the per capita consumption leader for most resources.**

Overall, National Geographic’s Greendex found that American consumers rank last of 17 countries surveyed in regard to sustainable behavior. Furthermore, the study found that U.S. consumers are among the least likely to feel guilty about the impact they have on the environment, yet they are near to top of the list in believing that individual choices could make a difference.

**Paradoxically, those with the lightest environmental footprint are also the most likely to feel both guilty and disempowered. “In what may be a major disconnect between perception and behavior, the study also shows that consumers who feel the guiltiest about their impact—those in China, India and Brazil—actually lead the pack in sustainable consumer choices,” says National Geographic’s Terry Garcia, who coordinates the annual Greendex study. “That’s despite Chinese and Indian consumers also being among the least confident that individual action can help the environment.”**

**On average, one American consumes as much energy as** 

o  **2 Japanese**

o  **6 Mexicans**

o  **13 Chinese**

o  **31 Indians**

o  **128 Bangladeshis**

o  **307 Tanzanians**

o  **370 Ethiopians**

**The average American individual daily consumption of water is 159 gallons, while more than half the world's population lives on 25 gallons.**

**Americans eat 815 billion calories of food each day - that's roughly 200 billion more than needed - enough to feed 80 million people.** 

**Americans throw out 200,000 tons of edible food daily. While 250 million people have died of hunger-related causes in the past quarter-century  roughly 10 million each year (that just shows that Americans dont really care about ""famines"".**

 **Each person in the industrialized world uses as much commercial energy as 10 people in the developing world. The poorest 10% accounted for just 0.5% and the wealthiest 10% accounted for 59% of all the consumption.**

Why are we focusing on the United States? Because **it consumes far more energy than any other country** \-- **more than China and Russia put together. Just five percent of the world's population consumes 23% of its energy!** That's really extravagant! Imagine if you wasted five times more gasoline as your neighbors... or five times more food... or produced five times more garbage. Your neighbors wouldn't be very happy! Yet, that's what we're doing.

How much energy does the average American consume? Well, if you list the countries of the world in order by their population (as we've done in the graph above), the U.S. comes in third... but the combined energy consumption of the other five largest **added together** doesn't match U.S. energy consumption! In other words, **the 5% of the world's population that lives in the** **U.S.** **has more environmental impact than the 51% that live in the other five largest countries.**

Next time you hear about a woman in India who has seven children, remember that **she'd have to have more than 20 children to match the impact of an American woman with just one child**. And an immigrant who moves to the U.S. is likely to **consume far more energy just by moving here**. Even if he scrimps and saves energy at home, every thing he buys will increase consumption of energy and other resources.

Huge social achievements were abolished, the rich became richer and the poor became poorer, while the income for the working class families shrinks year by year.

###Claim 1: Evo packed the court full of loyalists so that he could become president for life

In 2016, a referendum was held to establish whether Evo Morales would be able to run for re-election. He narrowly lost this referendum. 

Evo Morales agreed to abide by the results of the 2016 referendum preventing his candidacy for reelection until the Supreme Court reversed the decision. 

https://www.lostiempos.com/actualidad/pais/20171129/tribunal-constitucional-avala-reeleccion-indefinida-evo-morales

Many western outlets have claimed that Evo Morales packed the court in order to hold onto power. However, this claim is questionable. 

The 2009 Bolivian constitution, approved by referendum, specifies the process by which a person is put on the Supreme Court. You can read the full constitution here: https://web.archive.org/web/20090521023641/http://www.presidencia.gob.bo/download/constitucion.pdf

The process is as follows: Candidates for the constitutional court are preselected by the Legislative Assembly. There is one judge corresponding with each of the nine departments (states) in Bolivia. Each state votes for their judge and the winner of the popular vote is placed on the court.

It is absolutely dishonest to act like the Bolivian selection process is any less democratic than the one that exists in the vast majority of the world. In America, Supreme Court judges are selected by one person (the President, who doesn't even need to have ever won a popular vote nationwide) and approved without any input from the citizenry by the Senate (the chamber of Congress that least reflects popular will, as it is population-independent).

Evo has been in power since 2006. While that's a decent amount of time, let's not forget that Angela Merkel has been the head of the executive branch of Germany since 2005, and no one is questioning her mandate.

###Claim 2: The 2019 election was full of irregularities or rigged

This narrative has been perpetuated by the OAS and opposition groups in Bolivia without evidence.

The first claim of election irregularities was published in a press release by the OAS (https://www.oas.org/en/media_center/press_release.asp?sCodigo=E-085/19). Their claim: 

> The OAS Mission expresses its deep concern and surprise at the drastic and hard-to-explain change in the trend of the preliminary results revealed after the closing of the polls.

> At 19:40 on Sunday, October 20, the TSE disseminated the results of the TREP. These figures clearly indicated a second round, a trend that coincided with the only authorized quick count and the statistical exercise of the Mission. Our information was shared today with the TSE and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

> At 20:10, the TSE stopped disclosing preliminary results, by decision of the plenary, with more than 80% of the votes counted. 24 hours later, the TSE presented data with an inexplicable change in trend that drastically modifies the fate of the election and generates a loss of confidence in the electoral process.

To understand this situation, one must first understand Bolivia's election system. This statistical analysis, conducted by the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington DC, provides a good overview of the election system: http://cepr.net/images/stories/reports/bolivia-elections-2019-11.pdf?v=2

> There are potentially two rounds in Bolivia’s presidential elections. A candidate receiving either more than 50 percent of the vote, or at least 40 percent with a 10 percentage point lead over the runner-up in the first round, is declared the winner. If no candidate meets either of these requirements, the two candidates with the most votes must face each other in a runoff election.

> ...

> The TSE has two vote-counting systems. The first is a quick count known as the Transmisión de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (TREP, hereafter referred to as the quick count). This is a system that Bolivia and several other Latin American countries have implemented following OAS recommendations. It was implemented for the 2019 election by a private company in conjunction with the Servicio de Registro Cívico (SERECÍ), the civil registry service, and is designed to deliver a swift — but incomplete and not definitive — result on the night of the elections to give the media an indication of the voting tendency and to inform the public. The TSE is unlikely to process 100 percent of the results in the quick count in nationwide votes due to logistical limitations and the amount processed can vary widely by geography and the type of ballot. For example, in the 2016 nationwide constitutional referendum, it processed 81.2 percent of the results before it held a press conference at about 6:15 p.m. on election night. The 2016 autonomous referendum results were released for each jurisdiction with between 66.7 and 100 percent of the results processed at 7:30 p.m. on election night. In the 2017 judicial elections, an Electoral Experts Mission of the OAS praised the performance of the quick count system for releasing the results at 80 percent at around 9:30 PM. 

> The second vote-counting system is the official count (or cómputo), which is legally binding under Bolivian law. The official count is more thorough and precise and takes longer. It is the only valid vote tallying system, and the TSE uses it to determine and announce the final election results. 

> Once voting has concluded, individual ballots are counted in voting stations and aggregated into actas, or tally sheets. For the nonbinding quick count, the results from the tally sheets are sent to SERECÍ verification operators via a mobile app, along with photos of the sheets themselves. The tally sheets are then physically sent to a Departmental Electoral Tribunal (TED), where the information is verified and entered into the official count.

This same report also points out that the jump in votes noted by the OAS was not only statistically possible, but likely. The halt in TREP transmissions occurred because it took additional time for rural votes to arrive. Either way, no such irregularity occurred in the official count.

In addition, an analysis of polls in Bolivia ahead of the election seem to show similar results. Polls of eligible voters showed Evo receiving between 42.8 and 51.9 percent of votes against Mesa’s 25.6 to 34.3 percent: https://www.as-coa.org/articles/poll-tracker-bolivias-2019-presidential-race

The official election results, if anything, show a slight boost for Mesa, with Morales receiving 47.08% and Mesa receiving 36.51% of the vote. These results are not too different from the polling ahead of the election.

However, on Sunday, the OAS released their audit of the elections and recommended a new election. I took the time to read this audit and determine what their complaints were. You can find that audit’s text here (Spanish): http://www.oas.org/documents/spa/press/Informe-Auditoria-Bolivia-2019.pdf 

Their complaints, summarized: 
> Criticized the security and procedure of the computer systems for both the quick and the official count, including complaints about how it was tested, server configuration, and software access controls. 

> The redirection of transmissions from certain machines in the quick count TREP to an unrecognized external server.

> An analysis of several reported irregularities found 23% of them to be credible.

> The OAS acknowledged the difficulty of verifying results in the municipalities of Chuquisaca, Beni, Pando, Potosí and Santa Cruz due to destruction of ballots and election equipment [NOTE: this post-election destruction of election material occurred during protests organized by Morales’ opposition by anti-government demonstrators https://www.thenation.com/article/bolivia-elections-morales/ ]

> The procedural security of the elections in several precincts was found to be lacking (rules not being followed by local election officials) 

As a result, the OAS concluded:

> The audit team cannot validate the results of the present election, and recommends another electoral process. The future process must count with new electoral authorities to be able to carry out trustworthy elections.


###Claim 3: This is not a coup, but a restoration of democracy

As the results of this audit were released, Evo Morales immediately agreed to a new election with a new electoral commission. Despite this, opposition leaders Carlos Mesa and Luis Fernando Camacho demanded Evo’s resignation and the barring of his participation in the new election. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/10/evo-morales-concedes-to-new-elections-after-serious-irregularities-found

This is an ... interesting demand, since the OAS audit found no evidence of manipulation by the Morales government or his electoral board, they merely found flaws that could have been manipulated and their recommendation was that the government investigate these flaws and determine responsibility. Demanding a resignation by the President seems like a pretty hardline stance in this scenario.

Hours after this announcement, several generals held a press conference where they asked Morales to resign as president. Evo gave in to their demands shortly thereafter, agreeing to resign as president in order to “assure the social peace”. 

https://elpais.com/internacional/2019/11/10/actualidad/1573386514_263233.html

Police and military officials began arresting Supreme Court officials, Election Tribunal officials, and politicians from the MAS party after Evo resigned.

https://www.notimerica.com/politica/noticia-bolivia-detenidos-25-miembros-tribunales-electorales-irregularidades-comicios-presidenciales-20191111172213.html

A civil breakdown ensued, with supporters of both parties attacking homes and government buildings. Evo Morales’ own home was broken into and ransacked. The Venezuelan embassy in Bolivia was also sacked.

https://www.clarin.com/mundo/atacaron-casa-evo-morales-cochabamba-saqueos-varias-ciudades-bolivia_0_6zbi-rOV.html

Opposition leaders entered the government palace later on Sunday, including Luis Fernando Camacho. The Wiphala (indigenous flag which became the secondary flag of Bolivia) was torn down. One of the entrants (a pastor) placed a bible on the Bolivian flag and said “The bible has returned to the palace. The Pachamama will never return.” The Pachamama is an important goddess of the indigenous people of Bolivia.

https://www.jornada.com.mx/ultimas/mundo/2019/11/11/nunca-mas-volvera-la-pachamama-al-palacio-de-gobierno-en-bolivia-3923.html

Camacho himself is a former member of the Santa Cruz Youth Union, which, according to Max Blumenthal, is an explicitly right wing nationalist organization that has been involved in anti-Morales and anti-indigenous violence.

https://thegrayzone.com/2019/11/11/bolivia-coup-fascist-foreign-support-fernando-camacho/

The military and police have already stated they will begin operations to restore order in the city of El Alto. El Alto has historically been a site of indigenous protest and is an area that supports Evo Morales.

https://www.france24.com/es/20191112-bolivia-choques-policia-evo-mortales

Almost every politician in the immediate line of succession stepped down or was arrested following Morales’ removal. This includes Alvaro Garcia, the former Vice President, and the President of the Senate, Adriana Salvatierra (both MAS members). Jeanine Añez, the opposition leader in the Senate, has claimed the role of acting president. In other words, the leader of the minority party in the upper house has taken control of the executive branch despite the fact that Morales’ mandate from the 2014 election should have kept him in office until January of next year, when the next president would otherwise be inaugurated. 

https://www.elpais.com.uy/mundo/renuncia-evo-morales-quedara-cargo-bolivia.html

Morales has sought asylum in Mexico, and arrived there today. Jeanine Añez has said her transitional government’s only goal is to bring about new elections, but a date has not been given. The two houses of Congress still need to confirm her presidency.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-50383608

**As far as a coup goes, it doesn’t really matter whether the OAS audit is accurate in their assessment of election fraud.**

Evo Morales immediately agreed to carry out their request and only resigned after the military asked him to. This is definitionally a coup d’etat, and it’s highly unusual that it is not being reported on as such, especially since there is currently no acting president but the military has already begun enforcement actions unilaterally in El Alto.

###Bonus: This is obviously a US-backed operation, right?
Basic historical analysis leads one to suspect US involvement in some way or another, but it is important to be able to back these claims up with evidence. 

Recently, a series of leaked audio recordings seems to have provided the first pieces of clear evidence of outside involvement in Bolivia. 16 audio recordings suggest that figures from the American, Colombian, and Brazilian government have spoken to and supported Bolivian opposition leaders in their goal of removing Morales from power. US senators Marco Rubio, Bob Menendez, and Ted Cruz are all mentioned by name. The plans described in the leaked audio recordings include the burning down of houses of politicians and attacking the Cuban embassy.

https://elperiodicocr.com/bolivia-filtran-audios-de-lideres-opositores-llamando-a-un-golpe-de-estado-contra-evo-morales/

Marco Rubio had previously tweeted expressing concern over the Bolivian election shortly after the election, before the OAS issued its statement of concern over the election. Rubio wrote his tweet at 10:12 AM while the OAS report was published around 9 PM.

https://twitter.com/OAS_official/status/1186456799089692673

Donald Trump has applauded the Bolivian military for removing Evo Morales, calling his resignation a “victory for democracy.”
https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-donald-j-trump-regarding-resignation-bolivian-president-evo-morales/

The Grayzone reported on links between Bolivian opposition members and US intelligence regime change operatives. The founder of Rios de Pie, an allegedly environmental organization, has a number of circumstantial links to CANVAS, a CIA-linked group that has been involved in multiple regime change operations. Not hard evidence of anything, but suspicious.
https://thegrayzone.com/2019/08/29/western-regime-change-operatives-launch-campaign-to-blame-bolivias-evo-morales-for-the-amazon-fires/

Edit: Yuri Calderón (the general who demanded Morales’ resignation) worked as a military attaché in DC in 2013, and with APALA (Aggregated Police of Latin America) which is based in DC. 

https://twitter.com/jebsprague/status/1193986589749211136?s=21


I cannot say with absolute certainty that the US was involved in this coup but the historical considerations and circumstantial evidence match a pattern of previous US-backed regime change operations to a significant degree.

###Regardless of your opinion on Evo Morales and whether the election is questionable, there are very good reasons to be worried about the situation in Bolivia, especially for the indigenous populations who have historically faced racist violence and oppression. We have already seen destructive acts against indigenous symbols and the links between the coup-plotters and far-right groups are significant.

In the last video, a woman asks the victim being dragged away ""What's your name? We'll get you out"" The woman tells her her name and she replies to the victim ""It's ok friend, we've got you""...It seems doubtful the woman being illegally detained into a civilian-style vehicle is going to be legally processed and represented in court.  

One protester [spoke with](https://www.opb.org/news/article/federal-law-enforcement-unmarked-vehicles-portland-protesters/#.XxD9y_CwH4w.twitter) Oregon Public Broadcasting about his illegal abduction; “I am basically tossed into the van, and I had my beanie pulled over my face so I couldn’t see and they held my hands over my head...(after arriving at an unknown location) It was basically a process of facing many walls and corners as they patted me down and took my picture and rummaged through my belongings. One of them said, ‘This is a whole lot of nothing.”

The article continues to state after the protester was thrown in a cell, read his Miranda rights, asked if he wanted to waive his rights to council and speak with them, he declined and requested a lawyer, and 90 minutes later he was released with no paperwork, citation, or formal acknowledgment of their illegal activities. The article also states the location of his detainment was at a federal courthouse.

324,dg25qt,China Megathread 2: Debunking Western Propaganda,"It’s been a pretty overwhelming week on Reddit. Despite Chinese investment on the site, [we can see the censorship Redditors were decrying hit full force on here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/MoreTankieChapo/comments/dfy0om/after_thorough_research_into_the_top_posts_of_the/). But all sarcasm aside, I think it’s time to approach the allegations and sensationalism surrounding China again to at least cast some doubt against these ridiculous claims. After doing some more research on the topics that have been popping up on Reddit, I would like to, once again address the major misinformation Western propaganda is promoting. 

With that said, I want to first address the basic logical aspect and fallacies I notice a majority of  these pieces and arguments hit on. Before even diving into the specific allegations Western media is portraying, we must recognize the following:


**1.) Testimonies from ""witnesses"" are usually an unreliable source for their truth.**


I first started to notice this claim when studying North Korean defectors, and how many not only end up embellish the truth, but outright lie. It is no surprise [that many North Korean defectors inaccurately describe prison conditions, living standards, and absurd laws that they must abide by.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/13/why-do-north-korean-defector-testimonies-so-often-fall-apart). Additionally, many have become more skeptical because of the [inconsistent nature these defectors do tell their story]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkegD7V9E6g), when reiterating their tales about North Korea. It’s been later discovered that most of these stories are pressued by the South Korean government, [really doing some shady shit to keep these narratives alive, threatening family members and others]( https://www.reddit.com/r/FULLCOMMUNISM/comments/9ptoa4/loyal_citizens_of_pyongyang_in_seoul_%EC%84%9C%EC%9A%B8%EC%9D%98_%ED%8F%89%EC%96%91_%EC%8B%9C%EB%AF%BC%EB%93%A4_a/).  That last link is a great documentary not only debunking the lies surrounding from the DPRK, but also showing the immense pressure they are under to push these faulty narratives. Along with the fame and fortune some of these defectors obtain, these “witnesses” are truly unreliable sources for the truth. As a side note, some of these North Defactor stories end [in tragedy thanks to capitalism.]( https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/society/article/3023188/death-destitute-north-korean-mother-and-child-sparks-national). 

In US court, witnesses are only one aspect of evidence, *not the only aspect.* Opposing parties can even attack their credibility using their background, work, funding, etc. Whenever one sees a report that soley relies on the testimony of witnesses, whether they be doctors, or people of a certain religion, always be skeptical. Widespread horrendous behavior definitely needs more proof than mere superstition and witnesses that may be bias. 


**2.) Western media and NGOs should not be a credible source for information because of their use of unreliable sources, leaps in logic, and sensationalism if it is not coupled with legitimate unbias sources.**


Iraq's weapons of mass destruction; North Korea's belief in unicorns, strict haircuts, and unbelievable ability to bring back people from the dead; Venezuela bullshit; and many many tidbits about Muslim groups in the Middle East (stunning how all of the sudden they care about the Muslims in China now). Idk how many times Western media and NGOs have shot themselves in the foot making these ridiculous claims concerning other non-Western countries. There are some that report with primary sources, but some articles are far and few in-between. 

[This CNN article is probably the epitome of Western sensationalism, leaps of logic, and Western pandering.](https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/06/asia/china-xinjiang-video-intl-hnk/index.html) It’s about the China prison transfer. Despite stating: 

> CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of this video or the date it was shot. Chinese Foreign Ministry officials did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the video. In a statement to CNN on October 4, authorities in Xinjiang said that ""cracking down on crimes in accordance with law is the common practice of all countries. Xinjiang's crackdown on crimes has never been linked to ethnicities or religions,"" the statement added. ""Transporting inmates by judicial authorities (is related) to normal judicial activities.""

They go on to say:

> The YouTube account which uploaded the video described it as demonstrating the ""long-term suppression of human rights and fundamental freedoms by the Chinese government in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.""

They go on about Western intelligences, reporting from witnesses, and NGOs confirming it was fill of Uygurs (all of which we lopsidedly given their narratives to be true, even with the fallacies described above). 

Specifically with Western NGOs, [there has been countless documentaries on how most are being funded by the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which obtains its funds from the state department and CIA]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzIJ25ob1aA). Most NGO [being funded by NED spout against governments in order to destabilize them, with one former CIA official stating “they do what we use to do in the 1950s](https://youtu.be/FcW3_SzDmto?t=200). You don’t have to look far when it comes to this either (see Venezuela and NED’s funding of the opposition party). So obvious biases and sensationalism should not be supported through these sources. 

**3.) Reddit, and other media platforms have an unholy amount of Western bias**

[Western, white, males between the ages of 18-34 overwhelming make up the visits of the site](https://mediakix.com/blog/reddit-statistics-users-demographics/). 70% male, over 60% from the US, Canada, and UK, and between 55%-90% between the ages of 18-49 (18-29 making 55%). This creates a cultural bias on news with different cultures, countries, and governments. Take reddit’s opinions with a grain of salt, even if it has hundreds of thousands of upvotes. 

All that said, let’s get into some sources and details regarding some BS Western propaganda. Along with quoting some sources to prove these stories falsehoods, I will also add some logical analysis to go with it to help those understand China’s stances, or the ridiculous of such accusations: 

**1.) Organ Harvesting**

- [""According to their allegations, at one such site in Sujiatun, near the city of Shenyang, a hospital has been used as a detention center for 6,000 Falun Gong prisoners, three-fourths of whom are said to have been killed and had their organs harvested for profit. American officials from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and the U.S. consulate in Shenyang visited the area as well as inspected the hospital on two occasions and “found no evidence that the site is being used for any function other than as a normal public hospital.”](https://file.wikileaks.org/file/crs/RL33437.pdf)

- [CNN Claims on Chinese Organ Harvesting Are Not Credible](http://boston.indymedia.org/newswire/display/224096/index.phpCNN)

- [""No conclusive evidence has been located to either prove or disprove the allegations made by
the report. Both the authors of the report and its opponents note the difficulty of verifying
cases of human rights abuses within China, due to government secrecy and obstruction.
While there are many reports from other agencies indicating that China has been taking
organs from executed prisoners for some time, and, while some find the new report plausible
and have called for China to allow investigation of the claims it makes, no major human
rights commentator has fully supported its conclusions about the killing and taking of organs
from live unwilling Falun Gong prisoners. At the current stage the allegations made by the
report remain unproven and unsupported.""](https://www.refworld.org/pdfid/4b6fe16df.pdf)

> On its website, the China Tribunal says that it was “initiated by the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China (ETAC), an international not for profit organisation, with headquarters in Australia and National Committees in the UK, USA, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.”

> So what is ETAC, really?

> On ETAC’s website, one finds a “management” page with a list of people, devoid of any information except their names, photographs, and positions in the organization. The executive director and co-founder is Susie Hughes; Margo MacVicar is named as the New Zealand national manager; Rebecca James is the UK national manager for outreach, and so on.

> Where do these figures come from, and what brought them together? The website has no bios. **But follow the names, and it soon becomes apparent that there is another connection apart from ETAC — the Epoch Times.**

> A far-right anti-China propaganda network run by a cult
The Epoch Times, which uses the slogan “Truth and Tradition,” has marketed itself as just another conservative, pro-Trump media outlet.

> But NBC News published a major exposé in August revealing it to be the media arm of the opposition cult Falun Gong. The report details the bizarre workings of the Falun Gong organization, showing how the Epoch Times is carving a place for itself in American right-wing media.

> NBC News found that the Falun Gong website spent more than $1.5 million on roughly 11,000 pro-Trump advertisements on Facebook in just six months, “more than any organization outside of the Trump campaign itself, and more than most Democratic presidential candidates have spent on their own campaigns.”

https://thegrayzone.com/2019/09/30/reports-china-organ-harvesting-cult-falun-gong/

The article does a fantastic job on how the funding, right down the to key players and structure promote this propaganda in the West. I highly recommend the read to debunk this organ harvesting nonsense.

**LOGIC**: My biggest gripe with this is the fact that there is a major story about something as heinous as organ harvesting, when the only reports come from “witnesses.” **Even though it is medically impossible to harvest organs on live patients**, the West only has this as proof. No pictures, video, exposes, or anything besides witnesses and experts. If it is as widespread, and witnesses are able to talk about these things, I would assume there would be something more than their testimony. When you have other WESTERN country ambassadors and human right personel (let alone a report from the US Congress) stating “we can’t find anything”, it is truly telling what is really going on here. 

**2.) Ethnic cleansing, genocide, and mass internment**

> The estimate used most widely for over a year—of a million Uyghur Muslims held in Chinese camps—was arrived at using similar methods by a group called China Human Rights Defenders (CHRD), and by Zenz. CHRD, based in Hong Kong and Washington DC, interviewed dozens of Uyghur people in Xinjiang. Interviewees gave estimates of how many people—ranging from 8% to 20%—were being detained in their towns. It averaged out to 12% and CHRD bumped the percentage down to 10% for a conservative estimate, ultimately giving them 1.1 million Uyghur Muslims imprisoned. CHRD also found that up to 20% of Uyghur villages are required to attend “re-education” courses during the day, adding millions more Muslims affected by China’s campaign.

https://qz.com/1599393/how-researchers-estimate-1-million-uyghurs-are-detained-in-xinjiang/

That’s right. That one million number comes from a bunch of small interviews, applying (conservative!) estimates onto each an every town WITHOUT ACTUALLY CHECKING to estimate 1,000,000. Western NGO Interviews=math is, for some reason, good enough to make it in a UN report.

**3.) Corporations with no backbone/standing up for HK (Free Speech Arguments)**

This will be more of a logical breakdown of where this is stemming from, with a history lesson about China, with the hopes of those reading understanding why this hits a nerve with the Chinese people. [I think this Rick Sanchez segment does an excellent job on how Western media constantly berates a country without any knowledge or appreciation for its culture and sovereignty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcZJekubciY). 

Long story short, China has an embarrassing history [so embarrassing they actually call it “the “Century of Humiliation”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_of_humiliation) where intervention and imperialism by Western powers and Japan in China between 1839 and 1949 ran rampant in China and the government. **Thanks to the Chinese Communist Party (CPC), not only was China finally unified under one government, but they were able to PROSPER with obscene amounts of wealth to the point where even the World Bank states that they lifted 800 million out of poverty in one generation, something that has NEVER been done in human history.**

[What I’ve been hearing about this is that it is not about free speech.]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRLLW0BSa84). This is more about this concept: “**You cannot continue to profit from a country while blasting ignorant shit about it, from a place that has constantly exploited and harassed it for decades.**

**4.) Back to HK protests**

I wrote on these protests at infinintum, so I am going to copy/past my two other megathreads here as sources for these protests: 

> [The extradition bill cane about when a man from Hong Kong killed his pregnant girlfriend while in holiday in Taiwan. He fled back to Hong Kong. Taiwan asked for him to be extradited, but Hong Kong did not have an extradition treaty with Taiwan, so the administration in Hong Kong proposed a bill that would allow Taiwan, the PRC, and Macau to request extradition, which the judiciary in Hong Kong can then approve. [There were 49 crimes that were to be included in the bill that would allow extradition requests.](https://qz.com/1636663/the-37-crimes-included-in-hong-kongs-proposed-extradition-law/) Some of these were financial crimes, and the Bourgeoisie in Hong Kong shit themselves because they are often in breach of PRC law, but protected by Hong Kong's independence as a Special Administrative Region. This bill is completely reasonable, and any fears of the PRC taking over or of the extradition of 'political' criminals is unfounded. Right now I fear that the US is encouraging the organizers to keep protesting in order to provoke the administration in Hong Kong to crack down on them, so that they can blame China and keep up their propaganda narrative that 'CHINA BAD!']( https://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/c1nxga/opinions_on_hong_kong_protests/ered9wl/)

Now this is from an academic paper that lists out these atrocious laws while Hong Kong was under British Rule: 

-  Laws were passed to ensure that no Chinese would live in the most desirable areas in Hong Kong, which the British wished to preserve as their exclusive enclaves. 

- In a land in which ninety-eight percent of the population was Chinese, English was the official language. The Chinese language was not permitted to be used in government offices. Laws regulating conduct were written exclusively in English, a language which the vast majority of the population could not understand.

- The British unleashed a horrid opioid epidemic on the Chinese through Hong Kong. [Here is a clip of Professor Michael Parenti stating ""when the communist liberated Shanghai from the sponsored Kumintang reactionary government, in 1949, about 20% of the population of Shanghai, 1.2 million people, were drug addicts.""](https://youtu.be/6Tmi7JN3LkA?t=34). 

- ""The slave trade was merciful compared with the opium trade. We did not destroy the body of the Africans, for it was our immediate interest to keep them alive; we did not debase their natures, corrupt their minds, nor destroy their souls. But the opium sellers lays the body after he has corrupted, degraded and annihilated the moral being of unhappy sinners.""

- The more fucked up part about this was that the Chinese government seized some of the opium and destroyed it. But after the opium wars, they were forced to compensate the very people that were poisoning their country ($6 million). 

- ""The highest level British official in China in the late 1840s described Hong Kong as the “great receptacle of thieves and pirates protected by the technicalities of British law.”

- ""Hong Kong has been Chinese Territory since ancient times. This is a fact known to all, old and young in the world.... British imperialism came to china by pirate ships, provoked the criminal ""opium war"", massacred numerous Chinese people, and occupied the Chinese territory of Hong Kong.... It is the British imperialist who have come from thousands of miles away to seize our land by force and kill our compatriots"" 

- Sex slavery was a booming market, as girls were bought and sold by wealthy Chinese and British men. British rule legalized the sale of human beings and slavery, despite it being illegal in England. 

- Chinese residents were given curfews, and criminal punishments would range from legal physical beatings to bodily mutilation (compared to British rule breakers who would just pay a fine). 

This is only HALF of the paper that is well sourced with primary sources. You can find the paper [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iMH1v4MpPWjgH0WbfggIEqAfGV7mt0lQ/view) and [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2348771)

I still stand wholeheartedly with China here. It is absolutely unfair regarding the lack of understanding about China’s foundations; egregious racism, Sinophobia, and bigotry; and flat out lies people has been spreading about this nation that has gone through HELL to get where it is today. China is an economic miracle and has an enriching culture that everyone can learn from and implement. When I see that 1.4 billion has health insurance, housing, food, education, and clothes (even the poorest of the poor), while places of equal circumstances (like India) struggle to have anyone of these basic necessities, I know there is SO MUCH China can offer to the world. 

Additionally, if anyone is interested in doing projects or interviews regarding this, I’ll be more than happy to set up this and spread this information more. Just PM me.

326,bsx8js,Polish government trying to criminalize Marxism – act now!,"Polish  Sejm recently passed a new law that would literally threaten people with up to 3 years of imprisonment for possessing Marxist literature, equating  communism with Nazism, and The Communist Manifesto, even fucking Zizek  with Mein Kampf. And yes, it doesn't only mean Stalinism or Maoism, but  also eurocommunism, Trotskyism, even left communism and ancom, because  the act is written in such a vague way that it allows a really broad  interpretation of ""communism"". It still requires Senatorial and  Presidential approval and it's enactment might be delayed as it was a  motion that changed lots of other paragraphs in the Polish penal code,  so there is still time to act.

Also  some context to help you understand why they decided to pass it: it is a  result of their multiple failures to criminalize Marxists using the  existing law. It came after attempts to scare or disrupt academic  Marxists proved unlawful and inefficient, after the editors of ""Brzask"",  the newspaper of Communist Party of Poland won a lawsuit in which they  have been sued by the MP of the ruling nationalist conservative party  for using hammer and sickle in the aforementioned newspaper, after  attempts to erase the history by Instytut Pamięci Narodowej, the de  facto historical police (yeah this does sound like a fucking Ministry of  Truth because that is what they would become if the new law passes)  have failed a few times – like the attempt to change the name of Karl  Marx Street in Legnica or Dąbrowski Brigade Street in a few cities,  including Warsaw and Gdansk.

Here is my attempt to translate the changes:

curently:

""§  1. Who publicly preaches fascist or other totalitarian state system or  calls for hatred based on ethnic, national, racial, religious  differences or on the basis of non-belief shall be subject to fine,  limitation of freedom or up to 2 years of imprisonment.""

changes to:

""Who  publicly preaches Nazi, communist, fascist  or other totalitarian state  system or calls for hatred based on ethnic, national, racial, religious  differences or on the basis of non-belief shall be subject to up to 3  years of imprisonment.""

currently:

""§  2. The same punishment applies to the one who with the intention of  spreading produces, records or imports, purchases, stores, possesses,  presents, transports or sends printing, recording or other item with  content specified in § 1 or being a medium of fascist, communist or  other totalitarian symbolism""

changes to:

""  „§ 2. The same punishment applies to the one who with the intention of  spreading produces, records or imports, purchases, makes disposal of,  offers, stores, possesses, presents, transports or sends a printing,  recording or other item with content specified in § 1 or 1a or being a  medium of Nazi, communist, fascist or other totalitarian symbolism, used  in a way that preaches the content specified in  § 1 or 1a.""

Needless to say I'm rather disgusted about how the issue of trans people has basically turned people from principled revolutionaries who seek correct lines to hand wringing liberals who are worried about banning free speech alienating people:

Honestly I kinda have to say I'm a bit disappointed about how much apologism people are having for the CPGB-ML's line. Its a big reason why a lot of trans people don't trust ML's much as when horrifically backwards reactionary lines get spun, there comes in a wave of sudden apologism and justifications.

The r/Communism page was pretty much spammed with transphobic garbage by merely saying trans people belong. There's been a huge amount of long term members on here saying shit like ""Trans people are anti-materialism"" or ""Trans women are men stfu about LGBTWTFGARBAGE"". There's a serious issue in this community with trans-antagonism and honest to god a lot of the responses have been piss poor.

Why the fuck would CPGB-ML change their line when people are offering such limp wristed criticism. Trans people are one of the most marginal groups in society but the actual response to defending them has been piss poor. People are more mad at people who criticise Stalin or Mao then they are about the systematic attacks and repression of trans people in our society. Its fucking sick, I'm sick of LARPers who are more interested and passionate about debates in history about which past figure is the best or defending states that no longer exist over actually defending the marginal masses when they're under aggressive attack by 5th columnists in the movement.

Its frustrating. A lot of you are acting like Trots with rape allegations; excuses, apologism and downplaying. Just fucking take a stance to defend trans people, who fucking cares if they're fellow ML bros. What the fuck even is the point of saying you're pro trans when you all do diddly dick when your buddies call trans women men

This movement has a transphobia problem, its epidemic. If people were going around saying MRA lines and racist white supremaicist lines you'd know thats unacceptable. Now apply that same analysis to the current issue of transantagonism within these groups. It is not fucking hard. We don't need 'race realists' in the movement, we don't need incels or MGTOW's in the movement. If these people identify as Marxist to try and pollute the movement a push back would be needed to protect POC and women comrades. Where's the standing up for trans folks. CPGB-ML's stance is on par with the fucking Tories. That's a absolute national disgrace

Done with this rant, I'm sick of the liberal free speech hand wringing, y'all should know better

EDIT: Also to people who claim ""But a lot of people are reactionary"" the CPGB-ML is a PARTY, part of having a party is you're meant to advance people's line. If your party is actively degrading people's lines on important issues, the party might as well be Strasserite for all its worth. CPGB-ML aint even that large and their leadership has flipped off virtually every attempt to reform their line. Sometimes a abusive relationship has to be left, and CPGB-ML is one of those times.

EDITEDIT: Also educating is a two way street. If transphobes are just coming here to sealion or spout slurs with no intentions of changing their minds, you’re not educating them, you’re giving them a platform

EDITEDITEDIT: Yes I know some older folks have backwards lines on this issue. Being older doesn't excuse that. I'm sure there was a lot of older Marxists back in the 1930's that thought Unions should be for the white man. If people like Corbyn or god forbid even Sanders can hold a half way decent line on trans folks despite being incredibly old, then there's no excuse for older members of Communist parties. Are we saying that the older Communists are more reactionary than the older Social Democrats? I think that's selling old Communists short.",8795340433800,0

In reality, it is actually just boring and actively harmful with the lifestyles he actually perpetuates and supports, and then market it to the average person that has minimum in common with him.

During the height of the pandemic, Musk consistently tweeted about how the virus wasn't ""as bad"" as it really was and continued to spread false information. He compared it to the annual flu and mentioned about the ""losses of freedoms"" as if it was worse than the thousands of people dying. We all know he is a billionaire. We all know he will never be financially affected by a global pandemic, whereas it has turned thousands of others lives upside down. He's still making money at the end of the day, and making himself a real Ayn Rand character. He is consistently known for exploiting his workers, especially during the pandemic. He even sued the state of California, because COVID related work restrictions were put in place. All business/innovative credit goes to him, regardless of who actually did the work.

Translation:

----------------------------------------------------------------
#Suspect in the death of Marielle met with another of the accused in the condominium of Bolsonaro before the crime; upon entering, the suspect stated he was going to the president's house
####*Records show that Élcio Queiroz went directly to the home of Ronnie Lessa, suspected of shooting the councilwoman. That day, the attendance list of the House of Deputies shows that Jair Bolsonaro was in Brasilia, and not in Rio. The presence of the president's name in the investigations forces the STF (supreme court) to analyze the case.*

Jornal Nacional has obtained exclusive access to records of the lobby of the condominium where the two suspects alleged to have killed Councilwoman Marielle Franco and her driver Anderson Gomes. It is the same condominium where President Jair Bolsonaro lived.

The doorman told the police that, hours before the crime, the other suspect of the assassination entered the condominium and said he was going to Bolsonaro's house. But the records of attendance at the Chamber of Deputies show that Jair Bolsonaro was in Brasília on that day. Since the name of the president was quoted, the law obligates the STF to examine the situation. The report comes from Paulo Renato Soares, Tyndaro Menezes, and Leslie Leitão. 

On the day of the crime, the doorman worked in a security room, the only one that controls the entry to the condominium Vivendas da Barra. At 17:10, on March 14 2018, he records, by hand, in the book of visitors, the name of Élcio in a Logan vehicle with the licence plate AGH8202. The home he was visiting was number 58. 

Élcio is Élcio Queiroz, accused by the police of being the driver of the car used in the crime. The Jornal Nacional was able to ascertain the contents of his statements.

In the General Property Registry, apartment 58 belongs to Jair Messias Bolsonaro. The president also owns apartment 36, where one of his sons lives, Rio Councilman Carlos Bolsonaro.

The doorman explained that, after Élcio entered, he followed the cars movements through security camera's and saw that it had gone to house 66 of the condominium. House 66 is where Ronnie Lessa, the man accused of shooting Marielle and her driver Anderson, lives. Ronnie has been accused by the Public Minister and by the Homicide Detectives as the man who fired the shots.

The doorman said in his testimony that he called apartment 58 again, and that the man he identified as ""Seu Jair"" had said that he knew where Élcio was going. Jornal Nacional researched the records of the Chamber of Deputies and found a contradiction in the doorman's testimony. Jair Bolsonaro was in Brasilia that day, as the attendance records of 2 votes in the House show, at 14:00 and 20:30. Therefore, he could not have been in Rio. That same day, Bolsonaro also posted videos on social media outside and inside the cabinet in Brasilia.

Sources told our reporters that the two criminals left the condominium inside Ronnie Lessa's car, minutes after Élcio arrived, and then entered the car used in the crime in the vicinity of the condominium.

Jornal Nacional found that the condominium security room has equipment that records conversations through the intercom. The investigators are recovering the audio archives to find out who was present in apartment 58 and spoke with the doorman that day.  

The police apprehended the two suspects of Marielle's killing on March 12.

Ronnie Lessa is a retired sergeant of the military police and was arrested when he tried to escape his home, in the condominium Vivendas da Barra. Élcio Queiroz is an ex military policeman and was expelled from the force in 2015 for involvement in a crime.

The Jornal Nacional found that after learning of the information involving President Jair Bolsonaro's home in the investigations, representatives of the Public Ministry of Rio went to Brasilia on the 17th to make an appointment with the president of the Supreme Court, Dias Toffoli. Without warning the judge in Rio, they asked whether they could continue investigations after President Jair Bolsonaro's name appeared. Dias Toffoli has still not responded.

The police are calling former employees and people close to Marielle for new testimonies.

The police arrived at the man named as the killer by means of an anonymous complaint made in October 2018, 7 months after the investigation began, which revealed the name of one of the suspects and the location of the vehicle in Barra da Tijuca.

President Jair Bolsonaro's lawyer responded to the testimony of the doorman and claimed it was an attempt to attack the president's image.

""I deny that, it is a lie, it must be a typo or something. Jair Bolsonaro, on March 14 2018, found himself in Brasilia, in the Chamber of Deputies. In addition, there exists a record of his entrance there with his fingerprint and all the other evidence.

They had massive cuts to many departments 2 years ago which left the country less prepared and more vulnerable (all this to fund tax cuts for the rich). They had one month to prepare for the pandemic to reach us but was only worried trade and how this would affect the market. When people started getting infected, little to no actions were taken. Only when the stock market crash did they declare state of emergency. Since then they have been working tirelessly, not to help the people but to stabilize the stock market. Daily aid packages given to Wall Street and tests easily available to elites. 

Meanwhile working class people cannot find testing available if they do then they are still charged for testing and treatment. Insurance companies proceeding with business as usual. Shortage of medical equipment present in hospitals and clinics. Pharmaceutical companies lobbying government companies officials to make sure they make a big profit if they make a vaccine. Business are shutting down so employers are sending workers home, many without pay.

Congress won’t even give us all paid sick leave in the middle of a pandemic!Stores having empty shelves while many are allowed to hoard massive amounts of goods and reselling them at 10 times the price. 

As marxists we know that government officials are just  puppets of the bourgeoisie and that this system is not meant to work for the proletariat but for the bourgeoisie. So this isn’t surprising to us. But liberals still don’t see that. They just think X company is being greedy, or oligarchy, or reforms are necessary to make things better, or media bias, or it’s just Trump etc.

342,jeegal,Why Bolivia is the perfect example of everything socialists say.,"Firstly, In Lenin’s Imperialism, he describes how capitalism concentrates capital down to a handful of monopolies. These monopolies supersede the state, politics becomes their plaything. They can ‘coup whoever we want’, as Musk recently stated.

In Bolivia, the democratically elected socialist government was coup’d by a far-right, military dictatorship backed by the US and Musk. Why? Bolivia is naturally rich in the lithium needed for Musk’s Tesla car batteries. The rightful government was overthrown such that Musk can access cheaper lithium. Politics is their plaything.

Second, we see the continuation of the US’ foreign policy in Latin America, and the world more broadly. Why does socialism *’fail*’? Because the US never lets it succeed. Another socialist system was overthrown in Bolivia by US interests. Add Honduras, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Cuba (although they’ve been able to withstand it) to that list and you’ll notice a pattern. The US’ foreign policy particularly in the Global South since the Cold War, and arguably before, is a brutal one that will stop the the people exerting their right to self-determination wherever it may crop up; add the Eastern Bloc, Vietnam, China, Korea, Laos and the Indonesiato that list. The strategy they developed for crushing these socialist experiments in the Global South is called The Jakarta Method, after their coup strategies developed in the Indonesia. Radical Reflections has a great podcast episode discussing it, available [here](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1rrRtUaja73gUg5l0vxby0).

This is why being an anti-imperialist is a prerequisite for any socialist.

That’s why Bolivia is so important. Not only is it the perfect encapsulation of why we are anti-imperialist and anti-capitalist, but yesterday the socialists won. They won their general election. The Bolivian people stood up to US Imperialism and fascism and said ‘fuck you, not today’. We celebrate with the Bolivian people in their victory over the forces of imperialism.

348,kq6ead,Netflix’s “Queen’s Gambit” is Surprisingly Neutral or Even Positive Towards the Soviets.,"I finished watching it last night. Potential spoilers ahead, so careful if you wanna watch it. 

The basic premise is Elizabeth Harmon is a phenomenal chess prodigy. At the time, 1960s, the Soviets were the world beaters in the chess world. This, according to the show, is in no small part due to the fact that the Soviets work together as a team. They trade notes and formulate plans together. The Americans, on the other hand, treat the game as much more of an individualist endeavour; if you want to play chess, you’re on your own, pal!

By the end of the series, Elizabeth is in Moscow participating against the best the Soviets have to offer. Before arriving, a Christian charity offered to pay for her flights and accommodation provided she give a statement to the press against “those nasty, atheist Marxist-Leninists”. She declines their offer because it’s absurd to her. 

As a result, she needs the US State Department to help her get to Moscow. She is assigned an agent who ushers her from A to B when she arrives. He tells her “you’re not to leave your hotel room unless with me. Don’t answer your phone”, etc. 

The US agent has been told ‘x, y and z’ about how terrible the Soviets are and how Harmon should be careful and afraid to be there. 

At the climax of the film, on their taxi ride to the airport to return to the States, Harmon decides she won’t go with her security detail, she’ll walk. 

She won’t accept what she’s heard about the Soviets because her experience there has been entirely contrary to it. She decides she’ll walk these streets, talk to these people, and see it for herself. She ends up getting to know the local chess players. 

Overall, the Soviets weren’t depicted as the stereotypical bad guys they usually are. They were depicted as warm-hearted, team-working, cooperative people. The USSR was depicted not as an open-air prison, but as a normal, friendly place where people can walk down the streets completely safely and securely. The Soviet people weren’t depicted as mindless drones, toeing party line. They were real people, with compassion, empathy, hopes and dreams. 

It’s not much. I don’t know if I’d go as far as to say it’s positive towards the Soviets but it’s certainly the most positive depiction of the Soviets I’ve seen in western media.",3609723410738488334,0

>‘In 1981, grain imports and other agricultural products reached almost $12 billion, or about 40% of the U.S.S.R.’s total hard currency purchases. Despite the large‐scale expansion in agricultural imports though, **the Soviet Union remains basically self‐sufficient with respect to food. These imports are intended primarily to prevent a decline in meat consumption and are not essential to maintaining an adequate quantity of food consumption.** At 3,300 calories, average daily food intake equals that in developed Western countries. **Grain production is more than sufficient to meet consumer demand for bread and other cereal products.** To summarize, when we say that the U.S.S.R. is self‐sufficient, we do not mean that the Soviets neither need nor benefit from trade. Imports, particularly from the West, can play an important rôle in relieving critical deficiencies, spurring technologic progress, and generally improving Soviet economic performance. What we mean is that **the Soviet economy’s ability to remain viable in the absence of imports is much greater than that of most, possibly all, other industrialized economies.** Consequently the susceptibility of the Soviet Union to economic leverage tends to be limited.’

Imports were essentially supplementary; demanded more so for optimization than for emergencies. Nonetheless, it raises the question: why have food imports at all?

The agency glosses over this issue with the excuse that central planning and administration by fiat apply poorly to agriculture. However, there is one factor that they don’t discuss: the environment. Quoting pages 18–19 from [*Soviet Agriculture*](https://ia801202.us.archive.org/12/items/SovietAgricultureMorozov/SovietAgricultureMorozov.pdf):

>‘The natural and climatic conditions of the U.S.S.R.’s agriculture are both severe and unstable. No other major country faces such serious problems in overcoming their negative influence on agricultural production. Agroclimatologists estimate that on the average these conditions are 2–2.5 times worse than in the U.S.A. […] Generally over 60% of the country’s territory is periodically subjected to droughts and other unfavourable weather influences. At the same time that zone normally accounts for approximately 75% of grain deliveries. The year 1972 for example featured a snowless winter that destroyed the crops of 12 million hectares of sown land, then drought affected more than 100 million hectares of arable land. This is a very large area; almost twice the size of France. […] The drought in 1975 however was even more severe. In fact, Soviet farmers had never yet experienced such unfavourable conditions. More generally the frequency of droughts between 1963 and 1975 is matched only by that of the 1890s (when a series of harvest failures shook Russia).’

However (quoting pages 19–20):

>‘The country’s average yield per hectare of land was 8.3 centners in 1963, 9.5 centners in 1965, 12.1 centners in 1967, 14 centners in 1972, and 13.8 centners in 1975. The gross grain harvests in the corresponding years were 107.5 million tons, 121.1 million tons, 147.9 million tons, 168.2 million tons, and 140 million tons [a drought year, remember] respectively. […] In a sense, difficult years were a sort of test for our social system’s foundations, but they only show that the Soviet path of agricultural development and the agrarian policy […] which serves the needs of a comprehensive consolidation of collective and state farms, have been bearing fruit. In the U.S.S.R. the socio‐economic conditions governing the agricultural development are gradually reducing its dependence on spontaneous fluctuations in the weather as well as the work conditions’ harshness on the land.’",8795340433800,0

Another thing worth noting tho is that they actually added Mao to this list (I checked a couple of months ago and he wasn't there), which makes zero sense to me. Why remove multiple socialist leaders from the list but then add Mao, who is (in my opinion) the most bashed historical figure in history by the west?

367,l95t1a,Strive for revolution,"Dear comrades,

Whether you have communism in your lifetime, (the next 60-70 years), it should always be in your hearts. Communism, to me, has the central idea of human love. Please be kind to one another, and always have revolution in your mind. See past propaganda, engage with fellow comrades, and especially non-marxists. All of you have hearts of gold. Please be well, and remember what Che said.

“At the risk of seeming ridiculous, let me say that the true revolutionary is guided by a great feeling of love. It is impossible to think of a genuine revolutionary lacking this quality.”

&#x200B;

Workers of the world, unite! Viva la revolution!

Edit: to my comrades with hearts of gold thank you for thinking of me, and for the totally undeserved awards. I was just discharged from the hospital. I am trying to respond to all of your deeply caring messages. As ambivalent as i feel now, i feel much warmth from inside. I hope to keep fighting the good fight along with all of you. I love you!",8795340433800,0
368,9selfe,Life and survival guide for Brazilian comrades.,"""I believe in planning for the worst, while hoping the best. I hope that none of you will be in danger, and that no one you know and care about is in danger.

**PRACTICAL** **THINGS** **TO** **DO** **RIGHT** **OW**

1: get a VPN that has servers that the brazilian government can't subpoena. delete your social media accounts that you've used that have leftist and pro PT stuff on them. Make sure that going forward nothing is traceable to you. Any new media accounts you have that are political must be tied to a dummy email account.

2: if you have the means, keep a stash of money in a very safe place that's hidden but accessible. If the worst happens and you ever have to leave the country, you'll need bribe money. You'll need documents and authoritarian regimes don't always make it easy for certain people to get them. also keep a few gold rings hidden too. They're valuable everywhere you might end up.

3: get a passport now. get all those documents now. even if you don't plan to leave, get them right fucking now so you can be processed elsewhere and you'll be let on a flight if you need to go before the option might vanish. Keep copies in a bank box if your country's banks are reliable. Keep digital scans in an encrypted thumb drive. The digital scans can be used to get real copies at a brazilian embassy or consulate if your government is willing to still provide them to you.

4: if you take medication, keep careful track of your prescriptions. Always make sure that you have a 2 month supply that you can take with you. You might not be able to get the exact same meds in another country due to differences in regulatory approval for certain active ingredients and their approved applications, and it might take time to get a replacement drug in a host country.

**MENTAL** **HEALTH**

You're scared and angry. Maybe not necessarily for yourself even, but for others. That's good. That means you're still sane. That also means you're feeling a lot of alienation because you're surrounded by people who see nothing wrong with what is going on around you. It will get worse. That feeling will grow and fester. If you have empathy, you can never turn it off completely. You will feel like a stranger in your own country until this is over. Already you and people you care about have been demonized. Loan wolves, groups, and the state may all act on that demonization. Right now you may not even be sure what you can do and if you should even try to do anything. That's normal. But you have until January to decide what you do, and if you become a private person to try to protect your own safety, or if you decide to stay and become a public person to help others and yourself. If you can't be brave, then be kind. If you can't put yourself out there, and I'm not saying you should, then do what you can quietly until you can't bare it anymore and you have to leave. But until you decide how you're going to respond, you will feel alienated. If you ever feel numb, then you're loosing your humanity. You're going to have find a confidant. Maybe it's your spouse, maybe it's someone else in your life like your best friend. very few people can bare the emotional burden you will feel when it all kicks off and never say anything. You will need to talk to people, and you need to know they won't betray you if it gets extremely extremely bad. You will also feel anger. That's also normal. But quash it if you can. Anger can make you do reckless things. You will get your revenge by living and not conceding to the madness around you. You need to be smart. Assume that lists of names are being assembled. You can no longer speak out so openly. Make sure you know who you're talking to and who's listening.

 

Take care. No matter how bad it gets, remember that there are people who care deeply about you. You're never as alone as you might think you are. I've been asked in DMs about VPNs. Here's a great article that explains a lot about the pros and cons of some reputable major ones out there. I personally recommend NordVPN ""  ~ Via /u/adlerchen

Tips from other users:

-If you have a Portuguese grandparent, you are eligible for citizenship. via /u/AimingWineSnailz

-In regards to VPNs I would recommend Mullvad over NordVPN. One indicator that might be a good idea is that NordVPN does this (taken from OP's article):

> We use Google Analytics and third-party ticket/live chat tools (Zendesk/Zopim). Google Analytics is used to improve our website and provide our users with the most relevant information. The ticket/live chat tool is used to provide the best support in the industry (available 24/7), but not tracking our users by any means.
I mean, they don't even bother with shielding their users from fucking Google...

Mullvad meanwhile:

> We have no external elements at all on our website. We do use an external email provider; for those who want to email us, we encourage them to use PGP encryption which is the only effective way to keep email somewhat private. The decrypted content is only available to us.
Way better. That's not to say that NordVPN isn't decent a choice though!

If you can't afford a VPN subscription and need a free VPN go with ProtonVPN.

Also mail! Please change to something like either tutanota or protonmail.
 
~ Via /u/Sartanen

-**Recommended** **email** **providers:**

[Tutanota](https://tutanota.de/)

[Riseup](https://riseup.net/)

[Protonmail](https://protonmail.ch/)

**Regarding** **VPNs:**

The VPNs you will purchase most likely offers non-Brazil locations. Use them, not the ones located in Brazil. Can't afford a VPN? Use [Tor](https://torproject.org/). Can afford a VPN? Use Tor still. Most of these services are available with a dedicated .onion address which are more secure than the clearnet one.

**Secure** **payments**

Avoid using credit cards/bank accounts/etc for purchasing a VPN or other things you prefer to keep discreet whenever possible. Get Bitcoin or other currencies instead. Simply buying bitcoin from someone is usually enough, however for extra security you can tumble the coins using [Privcoin](https://privcoin.io/) or other coin mixers.

Check out [PrivacyTools.io](https://www.privacytools.io/) for more tools and tips for security.

Corbyn was showing some radical promise and a leftist agenda that some were really putting a lot of faith in. BUT DO NOT fall back into the neoliberal policies thinking that is the only way forward. We have the solution here

As communists, we are not surprised with the results here. We knew that sooner or later, something like this will serve as a wake-up call for the people. Capitalistic democracies fail to inspire people towards socialism and communism within its corrupt electoral processes. 

Now before the admins get all up in arms (pun intended); no this is not a call for violence. We are just restating what our old friend Karl Marx said:

REVOLUTION IS INEVITABLE. It is the only path forward in the late stages of capitalism, that will continue to decay and chip away at the people. No more phony welfare capitalism that continue to give false hope to the people. No more false prophets that lose elections, despite giving the people what they want. **We must educate, agitate, and organize to put the masses on notice that the movement of the people is the only way forward.**

374,fijvid,r/communism: The Book? (mega-mega-MEGA-thread),"EDIT: Added three more in!

Hello comrades. I've been a lurker on here for quite some time now, and I have to say that the amount of ""quality/master"" posts I've seen here is truly remarkable. The sheer amount of dedication you guys have towards providing detailed, evidence-backed texts showing the case for communism and Marxism-Leninism has been one of the main reasons that I began studying, and eventually fully embraced the ideology. I have not seen anything come close from any other political sub on Reddit.

And it has got me thinking, you could easily make a whole book out of all this sub's best posts! So that'd what I did... sort of.

I spent a bit of time taking a total of 54 masterposts and megathreads from members of this subreddit - including a few ones that were made in other subs by the same people - and arranging them all into a nice little mega-mega-MEGA-thread for all of you to enjoy. I separated them by ""chapters"", each one dedicated to a specific broad topic. As far as I know, this is the largest congregation of masterposts and megathreads on this sub.

Basically, it's one giant megathread made in the style of a book. Hopefully that makes a little bit of sense.

I made a few ""controversial"" decisions when making this. I didn't include masterposts/threads that were basically just link lists, like the [DPRK](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/cc41yz/dprk_megathread_part_1/) [threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/cc42bl/dprk_megathread_part_2/) or the [Everything A Leftist Must Know About China](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/c2b7ma/china_megathread_everything_a_leftist_must_know/) one, among a couple others. These are great posts, but I really wanted to show off the actual writing and analytical skills of the people on this sub, to make it feel like an actual book of arguments, rather then just a list of sources and nothing else. I also wanted to include only the most detailed and lengthy posts, so shorter megathreads are mostly not in here. Giant posts that are just excerpts from books are also excluded.

Obviously if you guys think I'm being a bit unfair, or if you think I've left out something good, or if I've put in something bad, tell me about it right away and I'll get to it as soon as I can.

378,pc0alk,"Stop trying to convince anticommunists that communism is good through debate, engage in class struggle instead!","Every few days there is a post on here or a similar forum asking for help putting someone's friend's or other close relations onto Communism. This is something a lot of new communists do. I did it myself years ago. I thought my friend might be interested in good natured discussion and I could enlighten him on the struggle of the proletariat. He immediately rejected it, spewed out a bunch of propaganda and unnuanced positions on communism, then refused to discuss further. 

This does not work and was never going to work because it is textbook idealist thinking and it is spontaneous. It is idealist because it assumes you can change the world (and cut through a century of anticommunist propaganda) through dialogue - through ideas. This is basically Hegelian and will only ever work on the occasional academic type. But we reject Hegel! We know the world is driven by material contradictions not ideological ones. Thus only dialogue will not convince anyone to be a communist. 

Anyone can be forgiven for making this mistake, especially new comrades. Instead we should look to how successful Marxists have practiced their craft. They did not go to the people with grand ideas about dialectical materialism or the dictatorship of the proletariat. The Marxists went to the people to solve their regular everyday struggles. Food, housing, wages, colonization, actual material conditions which people exist in. The Marxists organized them to engage in class struggle so that the people could learn that class struggle is *real* and that the people could fight back against their oppressors. 

If we wish to build the movement then we must do the same comrades. We must identify where people feel the oppression of the bourgeoise and help them resolve it through fighting back. In fighting, we can educate them about Marxism - merely a framework for understanding the reality they exist in, and communism -the world we want to build and the way we will build it. We can only teach class war to those who are already fighting it. If your friends, family, loved ones, coworkers, etc. do not want to hear about communism, then do not force it upon them. They will have to first learn it through struggle. Instead, lead them in that struggle.",5752004578039074169,0
379,kc9dym,The FALSE argument that ENDED socialism in Eastern Europe - how the CIA managed to trick the people,"After living in Eastern Europe and talking to many people on the subject of ""why socialism fell"" I realized that there is one predominant false argument which managed to make people think in the late 80's - early 90's that capitalism would be a better economic system and that was:

""People in Western Europe and the USA have better living conditions than we do, so capitalism must be a better system.""

Although there is hard to say exactly for each country how many people actually believed this, one thing is for certain: a good enough portion of the population brainwashed by the CIA propaganda network Radio Free Europe really believed this.

This false argument has morphed into an even more silly argument:

""We can now buy more goods than in 1988, so capitalism is better.""

Why is the first argument false? Well, because although it was true that people in western countries  were wealthier in 1988 for example, it doesn't take into consideration one thing: how low was the living standard before socialism in Eastern countries(let's say 1945 for non-Russia, or 1917 for Russia). It was ridiculously low.

* 80-90% of the population lived in rural areas
* no access to any modern facilities (healthcare, education, paved roads, clean water)
* they were a lot of them severely malnourished (in Romania the average for the rural area was 6g/meat per day which is 35-40 times lower than that of western Europe's peasants); they were eating mostly corn - 80% of their diet was corn
* mortality was insanely high

Life in Western countries was so much better in 1945 - as of why, that is another topic, but in short because they pillaged 80% of the globe for 200+ years.

So the correct and logical way to look at this is not to compare life in 1988 in Western versus Eastern countries, but to compare the progress that was made between 1945-1988 on both sides considering the starting points. If you do this you realize that those ""inefficient communists"" managed to transform in 40 years countries with near medieval living conditions into countries with decent living conditions, not as good as the western standard, but pretty close. They really decreased the huge gap between the two worlds.

Also, something hard to understand for most people is that workers in Western countries received more rights (pension, health insurance, shorter work day) just because the capitalist class was afraid of a socialist revolution. Basically, by simply existing the USSR improved the lives of workers in Western Europe.

Most countries which were extremely poor between 1920-1945 and didn't undergo a socialist revolution are still the poorest today with huge inequalities and limited human rights: Africa, India, Thailand, to name a few.

The second argument ""We can now buy more goods than in 1988, so capitalism is better."" is false because it fails to take into consideration the progress that would have been made between 1988 to 2020 if socialism was still in place.

This is why China nowadays looks like it's from the future and Eastern Europe + former USSR look like they had better days.

384,f7g3dj,Paying one half of the poor to kill the other half: Why Marxists should not support social democrats in the Imperial core.,"IE, why pushing for social democracy in the imperial core countries is a terrible idea. 

In Settlers, Sakai talks about how a lot of poor proles from europe who came to the US, *still pushed for the genocide and expropriation of native american lands*, because it meant that they could potentially get land for next to nothing. The colonial bourgeoisie were happy to give them that slice of the american pie, because it meant furthering the US goals of westward expansion, and building a garrison / middle layer of settler troops who would have their same goals in driving out Native Americans.

The same thing happened with the new deal, where workers were bribed with welfare and higher wages to abandon revolutionary organizations, coalitions with black and brown workers, and be pushed into settler unions (and management positions) who could do their bidding against various other working groups, creating yet another grouping of ""middle class / labor aristocrats"" whose goals aligned more with the bourgeoisie than with the poor. 

This new *new deal* Sanders is proposing is the same idea: that workers in the imperial core will accept a new round of welfare policies. Since the US is primarily a service / consumer goods import economy, social services are entirely funded off the backs of third world workers who get paid next to nothing in wages. [Sanders record of voting for US military intervention in 15+ countries](https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/socialism_faq.md#whats-wrong-with-bernie-sanders), his preference for lighter skinned social imperialists (like the nordic countries), his denigration of actually existing socialist movements (he calls Maduro a ""vicious tyrant""), and his anti-immigration stances are more than enough evidence that he wants to continue the US policy of enslaving the third world to feed the imperial core.

All of these are instances of **one half of the poor being bribed into killing the other half;** but in the modern day, its imperial core workers being bribed into continuing the exploitation of the third world to provide cheap products and enough surplus value to fund welfare policies. Rather than dismantling capitalism / imperialism, Sanders wants to increase taxes on billyahnayas, in which a cut of their imperialist superprofits will go towards first world welfare, thus strengthening the alliance between capital, and its labor aristocracy, much like the new deal. I know, we can call this new class collaborationist garrison of labor aristocrats, the ""middle class""! 

In fact, many forward-thinking capitalists are openly in support of this project: [Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Richard Branson, Sam Altman, are just a few billionaires who support a universal basic income](https://www.industryleadersmagazine.com/billionaire-entrepreneurs-who-support-universal-basic-income/), seeing its potential use as a finely tunable fuel source to quell class struggle, gain public support, and preserve their fortunes.

To quote /u/Guillotron9000 : 

> Nothing of the sort will happen. Even if Sanders is elected he'll pass M4A and most of his base will be satisfied. And the capitalists won't care too much either. They'll just make up for the losses by fucking over the third world even harder.
>
> The whole movement around Bernie isn't about socialism. It's about the Americans demanding a bigger part of the pie from their imperialist overlords. This is just a compromise between the capital and the workers in the imperial core. And it's not at all surprising either. Americans are already provided much more than their counterparts in the developing world.

The Marxist antivenom for this western chauvinist poison is organization that is internationalist in scope/aim, like many movements in the Global south (such as the Bolivarian revolution). Workers in the imperial core must continue to refuse these new deals, these bribes to preserve the US empire / western colonialism, keep supporting actually existing socialist movements, advocate for the [defeat of the US empire](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1915/jul/26.htm), and begin to build armed organization that can eventually challenge their police states.",-8827488425582937138,0

They continued the strike for a week in the face of the most savage police terror, in which officially 1,248 workers were wounded and a very large number - officially only 9 - were killed.

Lawless police and army violence smashed the strike. The resources of the racist state were mobilized, almost on a war footing, against the unarmed workmen. A profound result of the strike was the effect it had on the thinking of the national liberation movement - almost immediately it shifted significantly from a policy of concession to more dynamic and militant forms of struggle.

[They are just waiting for a ""Tiananmen-like"" massacre to happen](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/cpiaq0/disturbing_video_taken_in_shenzhen_just_across/), while the government has done everything they can to preserve peace and have respected the Special Administrative Regional Status. The amount of white savior complexes out there is incredibly high and promoting this BS. HK protesters know this. They are using this to their advantage by their [Waiving American Flags.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/cmqdl5/citizens_of_hong_kong_flying_american_flags_in/); [signs made in English.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/cp4sce/democracy_now/); and [singing the mother fucking US national anthem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYWuLoAYrgE).

If you want to witness the epitome of mainstream media failure, just see how shallow their coverage of the HK protests are. Same shit they've done to Venezuela. Only this time, they have a stronger agenda and target: China. China, even among the left, is a controversial government to say the least, but it is because of this weakness in our ranks, they pounce on it. It may not be another ""brown"" country the US can invade, but the same racism, bigotry, shallowness, and imperialist agenda loves to narrate on. 

With all this said, this will be more of a rhetoric based rant, since we all had our fair share of resources megathreads regarding this topic (however, I will sprinkle some resources to back most of my claims here). 

&gt; **Liberal Arguments and Rebuttals** 

**1. There are some leftist who support HK, and Marxist who criticize China's authoritarian rule.**

China's authoritarian rule has been blown up way out of proportion for the benefit of Western propaganda. From the Chinese revolution, to the Cultural revolution, all the way down to Tiananmen Square, Westerners, radlibs, and others in the left LOVE to gobble up Western propaganda to either go against China, or become communist apologists. [For more information on how this is all propaganda, I highly recommend readers to check out r/communism sources on their Debunk page, section 2: the people's republic of China](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/wiki/debunk#wiki_section_2.3A_the_people.27s_republic_of_china). Also, I have [written extensively on all the falsehoods on China, promoted by the West (even by some leftists), including their working conditions, social credit system, Uyghurs camps, Tiananmen square, and (the most ludicrous in my opinion) Falun Gong Organ Harvesting](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/c2b7ma/china_megathread_everything_a_leftist_must_know/).

[After reading all the materials regarding China, the one piece of literature that convinced me to fully support the PRC was President Xi Jinping's ""Uphold and Develop Socialism with Chinese Characteristics"", where he described this rift between leftists and China, and the steadfast economic rise and success they have despite of it. I highly recommend leftist from all sects to read it](https://palladiummag.com/2019/05/31/xi-jinping-in-translation-chinas-guiding-ideology/). 

I am going to be extremely generous here. Let's say there are leftist, marxist, or even communist groups in HK that are advocating for independence. Let's say they have strong theories, praxis, and reasons as to why independence will be great for the masses and what not. Hell, I will go so far to say that they are 100% independent, not using any Western funding, backing, or influences for their stance (I think we are really in fantasy land here, but let's give it to them).

THEY ARE STILL A MINORITY. I have already shown you the list of 37,000 NGOs in HK that receive money from the corrupt NED organization, State Department, and CIA. [The overwhelming amount of HK leaders and organizers meeting with US officials, along with funding, supplying, and sponsoring protests from the West](https://bitbucket.org/TheCrypticMan/hong-kong-protests/wiki/2019%20attempted%20'Black%20Revolution'#markdown-header-foreign-meddling-and-involvement-in-the-protests) drowns any real chance of leftist actually promoting the working people's agenda. Does any leftist honestly think that an independent HK would allow any sort of socialism or Marxism in their country?

We can no longer ignore the semantics of China. They are an economic threat to the West. These tensions are planned. We can argue about the correct measures to help our comrades, while understanding why there may be some measures to protect the CCP, revolution, and their people. But to fall to the West's propaganda and allow its Orientalist narrative to take root in our perspectives against China is unacceptable. They are our comrades. They are closer to our ideals than any capitalist country in the West. The enemy of our enemy, is not our friend. Without the proper diligence, we may be aligning ourselves with the true oppressor (US, CIA ,etc.), rather than those fighting against them (established socialist countries that have overthrown capitalism and are on their pathway towards socialism).  

**2. HK deserves to be independent!**

There are many things wrong with this statement. Hong Kong HEAVILY relies on China for its own financial stability, despite its gigantic economic inequality. [55% of Hong Kong’s trade and 80% of its tourists are from mainland China... Hong Kong’s GDP growth slowed down a bit, but by 2017 it was back on track. Then it was hit by the trade war with the Anglo countries, which is a bigger deal than the local unrest...](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-think-the-current-unrest-in-Hong-Kong-will-turn-out-in-the-longer-term/answer/Robin-Daverman)

&gt; ""Hong Kong people want money but are allergic to work, want democracy but are allergic to sharing. want to be respected but refuse to care about anybody else.""

If HK protesters were not waiving imperialist flags, or even, taking another step, REFUSING/REBUKING the aid of the West for its independence, I believe this ENTIRE conversation will be vastly different. If this was the case, communist would really analyze how China may deal with this problem internally. 

But this is not the case. The fingerprints of the CIA and US state department (along with GB and other Western counter parts) are all over this, at the most convenient time at the height of a trade war. Proof of this includes (but not limited to): 

- [Protesters getting PAID by organizers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31qhH9siwAU&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;app=desktop)

The People being used as a pawn for America's political gain against China. To be used like this is to do the imperialist bidding, as the US seeks to drastically influence and prop up this region through any means necessary. **I can only imagine if China states it will allow HK to be independent, and then the US will HEAVILY support its development for influence to the point where Taiwan, Macau, Tibet, and Xiongnu will want to separate, and become capitalist puppets as well (talk about Domino Theory).**

If you are focusing more on HK than you are on India, you've been duped. If you are praising what these protesters are doing, while lam-blasting BLM, you've been duped. If you think there are no parallels between Venezuela and HK, you have absolutely no idea how imperialism works and should not be involved with this discussion at all. 

**3. HK should have its democracy back!**

Back? From what point in history did HK ever had democracy under British rule? British imperialism was absolutely worse than what they have now. A quick history lesson is necessary to fully rebut this statement. Now this is from an academic paper that lists out these atrocious laws while Hong Kong was under British Rule: 

-  Laws were passed to ensure that no Chinese would live in the most desirable areas in Hong Kong, which the British wished to preserve as their exclusive enclaves. 

- In a land in which ninety-eight percent of the population was Chinese, English was the official language. The Chinese language was not permitted to be used in government offices. Laws regulating conduct were written exclusively in English, a language which the vast majority of the population could not understand.

- The British unleashed a horrid opioid epidemic on the Chinese through Hong Kong. [Here is a clip of Professor Michael Parenti stating ""when the communist liberated Shanghai from the sponsored Kumintang reactionary government, in 1949, about 20% of the population of Shanghai, 1.2 million people, were drug addicts.""](https://youtu.be/6Tmi7JN3LkA?t=34). 

- ""The slave trade was merciful compared with the opium trade. We did not destroy the body of the Africans, for it was our immediate interest to keep them alive; we did not debase their natures, corrupt their minds, nor destroy their souls. But the opium sellers lays the body after he has corrupted, degraded and annihilated the moral being of unhappy sinners.""

- The more fucked up part about this was that the Chinese government seized some of the opium and destroyed it. But after the opium wars, they were forced to compensate the very people that were poisoning their country ($6 million). 

- ""The highest level British official in China in the late 1840s described Hong Kong as the “great receptacle of thieves and pirates protected by the technicalities of British law.”

- **""Hong Kong has been Chinese Territory since ancient times.** This is a fact known to all, old and young in the world.... British imperialism came to china by pirate ships, provoked the criminal ""opium war"", massacred numerous Chinese people, and occupied the Chinese territory of Hong Kong.... It is the British imperialist who have come from thousands of miles away to seize our land by force and kill our compatriots"" 

- Sex slavery was a booming market, as girls were bought and sold by wealthy Chinese and British men. British rule legalized the sale of human beings and slavery, despite it being illegal in England. 

- Chinese residents were given curfews, and criminal punishments would range from legal physical beatings to bodily mutilation (compared to British rule breakers who would just pay a fine). 

This is only HALF of the paper that is well sourced with primary sources. You can find the paper [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iMH1v4MpPWjgH0WbfggIEqAfGV7mt0lQ/view) and [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2348771)

**4. So many people are involved with the protests, they can't be all CIA operatives!**

[As of 2017, more than 60% of Hong Kong citizens do not support the idea of independence for Hong Kong vs. 11.4% supporting independence.](https://i.redd.it/tc1txp3kgee31.png). Additionally, there is extreme doubt as to whether these crowds are as large as they seem, [with media drastically giving wrong calculations and numbers.]()

As of now, HK has one of the highest income inequalities in the world, along with a horrid housing crisis, with people sleeping in literal cages. 

[On August 6, 2019, The Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions; the largest union in Hong Kong with over 410,000 workers and a pro-Beijing orientation, makes a statement vehemently opposing the one-day strike launched by the anti-Beijing Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGFp0zIls2c)

[If you want to learn more about the Pro-Beijing Rallies that have been happening in HK (yes, they exist), see here](https://bitbucket.org/TheCrypticMan/hong-kong-protests/wiki/2019%20attempted%20'Black%20Revolution'#markdown-header-pro-china-rallies-and-demonstrations)

If all of this does not convince you that you should at least admit that this is a complex situation where the West should stay out of, then you are part of the problem. 

**5. So now you support Police Officers?**

This truly frustrates me because it illustrates the ""blind equality"" that some leftist give to ALL police without comprehending the systems, cultures, economics, and back stories of such institutions. Police in China are not the same as police in the US, which are deeply rooted in racism, slavery, and mass murder for the sake of private property. In addition, this entire point is irrelevant: whether or not police are there to maintain the peace or not, it does not resolve the tensions between HK protesters and the Chinese government. 

With this said, there are some serious security threats being made against the government, including [Hong Kong police bust city’s biggest bomb-making attempt](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3019429/bomb-disposal-squad-called-after-explosive-substance). Now, yes, this can be considered a rebellion and violence is involved for these reprisals. But again, with the US's fingerprints all over these protests, it is for their benefit. Not the people of HK. They are more than willing to sacrifice lives for the sake of political gain. 

We are obviously not hoping for a massacre to happen (if the media does report on one, I hope all of us will be highly skeptical at first before distancing ourselves from such acts). We do not support a brutal repression, but do point the hypocrisy of crying ""repression"" on one side, while complaining about protesters on the other (BLM, Colin Kaepernick, Occupy, etc.). As Mao Tse Tung said: ""Communist firmly stand for peace and are against war, but if the imperialists insist on war, we shall not be afraid of it.""  [Michael Parenti explains why every leftist must comprehend ""authoritarian measures"" taken by socialist governments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gtUaGV6mNI). But China does not even come close to the measures taken from their counterparts when it comes to the HK situation. 

**So with all that said: Chinese comrades, WE SUPPORT YOU.**

Thanks to r/Sino and u/murinal76 for this [incredible resource.](https://bitbucket.org/TheCrypticMan/hong-kong-protests/wiki/2019%20attempted%20'Black%20Revolution') I advise the mods to place this resource on the sidebar for users to review regarding the HK situation.

394,i031tq,Why are there not louder cries for investigations into US military corruption?,"(Not an american - I should have said in the title that I'm wondering why more USAans aren't calling for investigation)

It seems very strange that a country which has a military budget which is really too large to comprehend - at 732 billion they are spending [more than the next ten countries combined](https://www.pgpf.org/chart-archive/0053_defense-comparison) \- has not far outstripped the world with laser rifles and combat suits with invisibility cloaks etc. How could it be that, according to a [2018 US congressional report](https://sofrep.com/news/america-could-face-a-decisive-military-defeat-at-the-hands-of-russia-or-china-argues-new-congressional-report/), the USA could expect to lose in a war against either Russia or China?

I understand that military corruption is a part of what is called the Military Industrial Complex, and I think many people understand why such a thing is an evil. However, I think the common view is mostly that 'the US needs to remain at war with somebody because its arms industry is key to its economy', and not focused along the lines of errant spending, with millions being skimmed off the top - which seems to me the only sensible conclusion to draw.

With all of the refreshingly open talk in the USA about society's evils (even if most of these voices belong to liberals) I'm surprised this elephant in the room doesn't get more attention. If China's military is strong enough to stand down the USA we can consider every extra dollar the USA spends on military to be a waste, surely? If that is so then 471 billion dollars will be wasted/stolen/laundered this year. These are entirely surplus funds, and spending them elsewhere wound still leave 261 billion dollars (China's [reported budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures)) for unnecessary wars around the world for conservatives and liberals to get their teeth sunk into.

I have found some coverage of this point - [a 2015 article from The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/01/the-tragedy-of-the-american-military/383516/) and [a two-bit organisation trying to expose this](https://militarycorruption.com/) but here is [the wikipedia page for the USA military budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_the_United_States), which doesn't include the word 'corruption' even once.",-595511779102585996,0

That is our set policy. However, the United States is doing the opposite. It has been upping its pressure on China, and it has been blaming and bashing China, and the facts are clear for everyone to see. **For example, China's National People's Congress has never introduced any bill on the internal affairs of the United States. However, the US Congress has reviewed and adopted one bill after another that blatantly interferes in China's internal affairs. China has never sent its military vessels and aircraft to the neighborhood of the United States to flex muscles, yet the US naval ships and airplanes have been flexing muscles at China's doorsteps. China has never sanctioned any US businesses. On the contrary, we welcome US businesses to invest in China, and we have provided them with a sound business environment. However, the United States has tried every opportunity and means to suppress Chinese companies. It has introduced unilateral sanctions against Chinese companies by exercising long-arm jurisdiction, and tried to limit China's development rights.** So talking about threat, it is not that China is threatening the US, but the US is threatening China. And the issue is how to address the US threat to China.

It's been burning for weeks and not even those who live in Brazil were fully aware. Thanks to the efforts of local communities with the help of social networks, the reality is finally going viral.

The online reaction is far from being sensationalist. This year alone, Brazil had 72,000 fire outbreaks, half of which are in the Amazon. The National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) reported that its satellite data showed an 84% increase on the same period in 2018.

Whether this is a legitimate delay or not (its not), people are increasingly losing faith in their democracy, and for good reason.

When we explained how that's not only illegal but the worst SEO thing you could do, he accused us of scheming to charge him extra for writing his content. Wew lad.

- Guy who wants a social network for giving gifts.

If someone you're arguing with presents to you a NYT article, if you're *so sure* the NYT is a capitalist mouthpiece, dissect the article and identify its faults. Don't just dismiss the NYT all together. Who is that going to convince?

So many people on the left have no idea what fascism is because they fear the idea of reading what fascists themselves actually believe. So many people on the left are more eager to throw Jacobin and Guardian link piles at you that supposedly support their narrative without seeing if the arguments presented have any real substance.

I'm not saying that sources that are continually exposed to have multiple faults or conflicts of interest shouldn't always be taken with a grain of salt. **But there are different levels of fallacy... and this matters.** 

NYT has published articles that fudge numbers. They've published articles with unverified sources. They've published articles that leave out huge chunks of the situation. They've published articles with sources linked to people with huge conflicts of interest. They've published articles with flat out fabrications with zero evidence. *But they've also published perfectly sound articles.* That's the nature of these major Western publishers. Not everything they post is garbage, but when it is, know that a lot of people have no idea how or why. Show them.

I understand that politics and history is time consuming and exhausting. Sometimes I just wanna know that what someone is telling me is correct and not have to dissect it every time. In fact, I definitely *don't* do this with everything I read. No one does. But guys, we're communists. It takes a complex worldview to get to where we are in the first place. When you're discussing with people you're trying to convince, prove to the other person and to yourself that you actually read what they provided. People don't respond well to being dismissed.",-4379213737691068285,0

 Brazil is going through a REALLY hard time, fascism has already taken our entire government and nothing is being done, literally nothing... The pandemic is going at full power now and we should expect at least 5 thousand deaths a day in the next few weeks and if things don't change we will easily get to 10 thousand deaths a day in a matter of a few months, the government denies that the situation is critical and they say that it's ""confortable"", well... it's not.  
   
 But what does this have to do with communism? Fascists kills communists and I am a communist living in a fascist country with a fascist police (and 60% of the population don't have any idea of what is slowly happening inside here, mainly because of fake news created by the executive power)... so you may know what can happen with me and other comrades if things don't change in the next few years.  
 Besides the ""ideological"" part of Brazil, I would like you to know that we are slowly developing super strains of COVID-19 due to people living their lives like nothing is happening, this means that we have a small chance of creating a strain that is immune to the vaccines and restart things all over the world again... Also, we are one of the largest powers in the world, if things go south here, things go south all around the world.  
 Capitalist ""democracy"" in Brazil is really unstable. Please comrades, the rest of the world has to know what is happening here, it's madness and I am afraid of our future....",744288663772684728,0
413,igd09a,"On this day 99 years ago, the Battle of Blair Mountain - the largest labor uprising in U.S. history - began."," The [Battle of Blair Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Blair_Mountain) was the largest labor uprising in United States history and the largest armed uprising since the American Civil War. The conflict began [on this day](https://www.apeoplescalendar.org/day/8-25) in Logan County, West Virginia, as part of the ""Coal Wars"", a series of early-20th-century labor disputes in Appalachia. Up to 100 people were killed (although estimates vary widely), and nearly one thousand miners were arrested on multiple charges, including murder and treason.

For five days, from late August to early September 1921, some 10,000 armed coal miners confronted 3,000 lawmen and strikebreakers who were backed by coal mine operators during the miners' attempt to unionize the southwestern West Virginia coalfields. The front was more than 10 miles long at one point. The battle ended after approximately one million rounds were fired, aerial bombardment of the miners, and the United States Army's arrival, intervening on orders from the president. Notably, the miners had no issues shooting at cops and Baldwin-Felts agents, but did not want to fight with federal troops (many were veterans themselves).

In recent years, some coal companies have been trying to destroy the historical site where the fighting happened. This, despite there never having been a complete archaeological survey of it. You can read more about the fight to preserve this heritage [here](https://tclf.org/battle-blair-mountain-still-being-waged).

414,kcrep3,Why the education system was BETTER under SOCIALISM and why the capitalist education system is a JOKE,"As an Eastern European/Russian/Other Soviets,  if you were alive 30-35 years ago, you managed to see the quality of your education system decline, the standards ever lowering while the students struggle more and more to graduate. I tell you this after getting a bachelor degree in Engineering, talking to most of the teachers about then/now and working for two years in Education. But why has the standard lowered so much?

Well, in order to understand this we first need to understand what was lost.

* although salaries where not equal, the inequality was very low (the maximum to minimum salary ratio was about 3-1). In contrast to the capitalist system, the workers with the most dangerous or difficult jobs had salaries bigger than people in leadership positions(engineers for example)/ party officials etc. This low financial inequality led people into following what they are good at (what they enjoyed) at a much higher rate than in capitalism
* the correlation between the number of jobs in a specific field and the number of available positions for students in that field. What do I mean by that? Let's say the country needed about 1000 chemical engineers a year - there would be about 1000 positions in universities for studying chemical engineering. This meant that once you graduated you had a value and a purpose in society. Based on your skillset and the job ""market"" they would ask you once you graduated where do you want to work. Then they would give you an apartment/house in that city/town/village.
* it was always free

Because these very important things were lost, nowadays graduating from 90% of the universities do not guarantee you will actually get a job in the field you studied and students feel that and they don't study hard.

It used to be that what society admired was educated people, but nowadays people would rather be rich and uneducated because they feel how bad is it to be a wage slave.

The fact that the question: ""What am I really good at?"" turned into ""What pays off in today's job market?"" is in my opinion the biggest problem. It makes individuals not to follow their talent and this leads to seeing mediocre miserable individuals doing most of the jobs.

Also, the quality of the teachers educated in socialism is amazing. Eastern Europe + the former USSR still have some remnants of those times long gone.

There's no way I could ever provide you with a full scope of the situation. Propaganda is not meant to be obvious. The media is not something that is independent from the state. Instead, the state and the media both grow out of the property relations of capitalism, and are both controlled by capital to ensure labour extraction by coercive force and to propagate the mainstream neoliberal culture of public opinion respectively. This is also only one issue in a massive propaganda war. You are constantly being bombarded by lies. Don't make the mistake of thinking this is a one-off instance of manipulation of public opinion for ulterior motives. *You are not immune to propaganda.*

Nearly 100 scholars and religious leaders in Xinjiang refute Pompeo with joint letter:[https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1158473.shtml](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1158473.shtml)

>You said that Xinjiang is butchering systematically the Uyghur culture, but where is your evidence? The constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates that the state protects the lawful rights and interests of every ethnic group, and helps ethnic minority regions achieve a faster pace of economic and cultural development. Xinjiang has put a lot of efforts into the protection, inheritance and promotion of each ethnic minority's culture. Courses on ethnic minority languages are provided by all the schools under the compulsory education system...Your claims that Xinjiang is terminating Islamic beliefs and that Chinese government severely persecutes believers of various religions are not based on facts at all. It is a longstanding basic policy of the Chinese government to respect and protect the freedom of religious belief. Xinjiang has never associated the crackdown on terrorism and extremism with any specific ethnic group or religion. The local government of Xinjiang protects the normal religious activities and fulfills the reasonable religious demands of believers in accordance with the law. In Xinjiang, there are 24,400 mosques and 29,000 religious clerics. There are 10 religious colleges including the Xinjiang Islamic Institute, enrolling more than 1,300 students annually. In Xinjiang, for every 530 Muslims there is one mosque, a figure that exceeds many Muslim countries.

Comrades, we need your help to demand the charges leveled against the activists in Colorado be dropped immediately!!

🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨 

If you have not already heard, 5 activists in Denver are facing years in prison on false charges because of their leadership in the movement for justice for Elijah McClain. Elijah McClain was killed by police officers in Aurora, Colorado who put him in a chokehold on August 30, 2019 despite the fact that he was unarmed and simply walking down the street listening to music. More information from the New York Times can be found here: https://www.nytimes.com/article/who-was-elijah-mcclain.html

On Sept. 17, several protest leaders, including four of my comrades in the Party for Socialism and Liberation, were arrested in Denver, Colorado in a coordinated police attack. Some were surrounded by police cruisers while driving, had their homes surrounded by SWAT teams with APCs, or were grabbed by police while out shopping. The organizers now face over 30 bogus charges including “kidnapping” and “inciting a riot,” and potentially decades in prison. The state is claiming that during a peaceful protest outside of a police station, the organizers kidnapped 18 police officers by intimidating them to the point that they felt like they were not able to leave. The embarrassing claims the state put forward would be comical if they weren’t so severe. They were targeted because of their dedicated organizing efforts in recent months. The same District Attorney, Dave Young, who has refused to charge the police officers who murdered Elijah McClain, directed these felony arrests of the organizers who have been leading the peaceful protest against him.

He came to prominence in Chicago as chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party (BPP), and deputy chairman of the national BPP. In this role, he founded a prominent multicultural political organization known as the ""Rainbow Coalition"" comprised of the BPP, the Young Patriots, the Young Lords, and an alliance among major Chicago street gangs to help them end infighting.

In 1967, Hampton was identified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as a radical threat. The FBI tried to subvert his activities in Chicago, sowing disinformation among these groups and placing a counterintelligence operative in the local Panthers. In December 1969, Hampton was assassinated during a predawn raid at his Chicago apartment by the Chicago Police Department. During the raid, Panther Mark Clark was also killed.

At a press conference the next day, the police announced the arrest team had been attacked by the ""violent"" and ""extremely vicious"" Panthers, and had defended themselves accordingly. In another press conference, police leadership praised the assault team for their ""remarkable restraint"" and ""professional discipline"" in not killing all the Panthers present. Photographic evidence was presented of bullet holes allegedly made by shots fired by the Panthers, but this was soon challenged. Later, it was found that all but one of nearly one hundred shots were fired by the police.

They are literally using bows and arrows, and users all over Reddit are salivating for Police to use live ammo against these protesters, so they can justify some sort of intervention and their false hope of “free Hong Kong.”

The only death that has occurred in the Hong Kong protests was this 70-year-old man, who was killed by the protesters themselves. 

Meanwhile, [“More than 260 Iraqis have been killed in demonstrations since the start of October](https://www.france24.com/en/20191105-iraq-cuts-off-internet-as-renewed-anti-government-protests-escalate-1). 

And where do you think Reddit’s attention is at? Not at the brown countries. They are getting their white-knight complexes stroked like no other with Hong Kong. I WISH Reddit can get as excited to hear that the infantry is joining Bolivian indigenous communities rather than yearning for deaths over a university occupation. And, in usual anti-climactic fashion, the police come in, make arrests, and… that’s it. It’s foolishness that they want the PLA or whoever to come in and start shooting. 

Can you imagine if the current HK Chief Executive Carrie Lam gave impunity to police officers so they cannot get persecuted if they kill protesters like they did in Bolivia? Can you imagine if police acted like Iraqi security forces against the protesters? 

Before anyone gets into whether this is “police apologia” I want to quickly dismiss that by saying fuck your phony distraction in protecting Western media BS. I am not one to protect or support police. They are doing their jobs, and this is part of it, fine. But as a god damn minority in the United States, I am waiving my fucking hands here saying, if you don’t like what HK is doing **WHERE THE FUCK WERE YOU WITH BLM?** Where were you for Mike Brown and Ferguson?

Today it has all came to me finally. 20 years of moving will show you the disgusting side of capitalism. Without going on all day about my point I have decided to keep it simple. We have moved very rich, sometimes celebrities and influential people all throughout Texas.

These people have everything you can imagine. Multiple houses, beach houses, lake houses, art costing of $100,000, pets worth more than my car, top of the line vehicles, electronics, children are in expensive private schools, best clothes you could imagine, cosmetics, food and alcohol, and probably even the pen they write the check with. I have seen it all.

Usually their move consists of multiple trips, workers and trucks, packing and materials, sometimes long distance, assembly, and sometimes multiple days. These people will literally tell us they wouldn't even get out of bed for what we make. Now when it comes time to pay they almost always complain. They even have the nerve to complain over $3000. 

They won't get out of bed for what we make but expect us to? We are not worth that price but they are worth the $500,000 and up a year to sit at a desk? They never argue about spending $100k on a painting or buying a mansion with a new Porsche. It is easy and they say it is worth it.

This post is not going to be an essay, even though it perhaps deserves being an essay, because a) this is a consistent theme throughout the ENTIRE works of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin (who write about it with much more intelligence than I can), and b) the format I'm choosing I think most approximates what 'sticks' in Internet culture. Instead, I'm going to list several clichés with seemingly little connection and then try to explain the issue with them and how they're connected. 

**1. Landlords and bankers are not especially exploitative and furthermore are integral to the functioning of capitalism**

Marx's critique of political economy begins with the assumption that the production of surplus-value logically precedes the formation of an average rate of profit and its division into its subforms among the various capitalists. Profit, interest, and rent, that is to say, are nothing more than divisions of the total surplus-value produced by the working class; the exploitation, then, of the workers is the independent variable and the division of the spoils the dependent variable. While merchant and money capital on the one hand, and landed capital on the other, predate capitalism (as a mode of production), it is this mode of production which unites these together into a circulation process geared towards capital's valorization through the exploitation of labor-power. The attack on landlords and bankers is typical of classical political economy (hence the [meme](https://preview.redd.it/s1oq6ejh55q21.jpg?auto=webp&s=9ed716bfdecbb83cb3407854cc979ae2cf681668) of the JB Say and Adam Smith), where the rising bourgeoisie was fighting to ensure that the bulk of surplus-value produced would not be fleeced out of its hands. The continued existence of these separate circuits and capitalists specializing in one and not the other, however, no longer speaks towards the especially 'reactionary' character of landlords or bankers; rather, given that the nobility as a class have been crushed, it means that they play a role entirely rational within the contours of the capitalist mode of production. (This much may be understood by considering credit, but it is beyond our purposes to have to explain why credit exists. 'Limits to Capital' Chapter 11 considers this with regard to the land market.) The logic of capitalism is to eliminate any cost it finds unbearable; to attempt to explain their continued existence in spite of their alleged irrationality by the ""power"" of these groups necessarily runs into the terrain of conspiracy theory. The discourse around 'bankers' and landlords is necessarily one of moral outrage over these groups being alien and harmful to the community (the 'people'), etc., with the implicit assumption of the former being that they are unproductive, squandering resources, etc. In other words, the they are attacked for being insufficiently capitalist. Not only is this an inherently petty-bourgeois demand, it is a falsehood. Marx remarked somewhere that if the Pereire brothers had not assembled into their hands all the capital of France, the national railroads would have taken ages to be built. Credit retains this revolutionary role today given it pushes production well beyond the confines of the market -- despite progressives finger wagging over speculative overlending (despite, of course, being incapable of explaining its cyclical recurrence without reference to so-called animal spirits), etc. On the other hand, Marxism is marked by a clear break with the Rousseauian tradition of privileging 'the people'. Capitalism itself must be applauded for dissolving 'the people' into *class*, and it is not socialism which seeks to 'cleanse' society in the name of the people but rather fascism and its holocaust. The process of proletarianization unleashed by capitalism, with all of its destructiveness (""the death of the middle class"", the erasure of cultural difference, etc.) is brought towards its conclusion under socialism. It is not a rhetorical twist to claim that when people rail on about 'bankers' they really mean 'Jews', because the latter is nothing more than a label attached to the expression of an underlying view that there exists a group necessarily opposed to 'the people'. The only way in which a group known as 'the people' may be posited is through an act of exclusion: the people, and the other. Thus all the contradictions *immanent* to capitalist society are chalked up to the existence of the 'other'; 'greedy bankers' have done x, y, and z and 'crashed the economy'. This is ultimately nothing more than an expression of the pathological logic of anti-Semitism. Capitalists only exist insofar as they are the personifications of *capital*, and should they cease to function according to this role they cease to be capitalists and yet *capital* remains in existence. 


**2. Poverty does not exist because there're too many 0's in Jeff Bezos' bank account**

You see this a lot on LSC. I have already remarked that production precedes distribution. Now I must make the rather banal point that the latter is in the final analysis determined by the former. The way in which wealth is distributed under capitalism is something which can fall within a contingent range of possibilities, *but that the production of wealth assumes the form of the production of value is continually asserted by its invisible 'laws of motion'*. Try operating a business where you produce stuff, buying the inputs on the market and paying wages, and then give it out for free. You're not going to last very long. Poverty is not called forth by the fact capitalists have 'too much money'. This carries with it the assumption that the crux of the matter lies not with the division of society into classes, but the division of the wealth produced by the working class. Rather, the condition for the possibility of capitalism is a class of expropriated persons unable to produce their own means of subsistence. The instruments necessary to produce this (means of production), must consequently be consolidated as the monopoly of another class. Further, Marx does not adhere to an ""iron law of wages"", this is true -- but he does not reject the Ricardian postulate that wages and profits exist in an inverse ratio. This is why there exists a relative surplus population; the industrial reserve army is logically necessary to prevent profits from falling to zero. Now, if we were to legislate that capitalists must pay $100/hr minimum wage, the only effect would be for capitalists to cease investing for the obvious reason that there would be no profits to be made made. If capitalists ceased to invest, the industrial reserve army would be reconstituted and workers would gladly resume working for well below that wage. No matter what, in short, you're always fucked.

**3. Capitalists (as an ideal representation of capital in the form of a person) are not thieves**

What differentiates Marx's critique from that of the earlier socialist economists, the so-called Ricardian socialists, is that it begins from the assumption of an equivalent exchange. A profit is not a 'mark-up' added to the cost of producing something paid either at the expense of the consumer or through denying the worker a 'fair wage'. This implies profits come from circulation, and it goes without saying that this runs into absurdity when one asks how this is ultimately paid for. Where did the money for the ""original"" mark-up come from? This view is characteristic of the premature views of the mercantilists, whereas we must seek the origin of profit in production -- something new being created that did not exist before, or *growth*. Marx furthermore distinguishes between labor, as a measure of value, and labor-power, as a commodity whose use-value is the ability to labor and therefore produce value. Workers for Marx are simultaneously exploited and paid a ""fair wage"" -- i.e., equivalent to the value of labor-power. Why? Because, in circulation, the capitalist pays a ""fair price"" for what he is purchasing, labor-power, which subsequently, during production, produces a surplus-value. There is no ""stealing"" because what belongs to the worker is not the commodities produced during production, but rather his or her labor-power, for which they have already been compensated. What service the labor union actually performs then, according to Marxists, is to ensure workers are paid a ""fair wage"". But let's recast that in a different light: the purpose of unions is to ensure workers are only exploited as opposed to super-exploited. To ensure workers are exploited? The point is that this is perfectly compatible with capitalism as I have just said and is thus, politically, an essentially conservative demand. ""Instead of the conservative motto, ‘A fair day's wage for a fair day's work!’ they ought"", Marx writes, ""to inscribe on their banner the revolutionary watchword, ‘Abolition of the wages system!’""

The origin of this demand is perhaps to be found in the deskilling of labor which accompanies capitalist development. Artisans, naturally, revolt against their monopoly being broken, and demand special treatment. In the US, e.g., they may even demand ""white man's wages"" when confronted by other workers undercutting them and forcing them to accept lower wages, i.e., the operation of what bourgeois economists call the law of one price in the labor market (or what we would call an aspect of the law of value). Socialism however is not a movement of the Luddite holdovers of yesterday, but a movement of the 'unskilled' proletariat called forth by capitalism. We stake our claim not on the unions of the labor aristocracy but on the as yet unorganized, ""cheap"" and ""foreign"" proletariat. And we applaud capitalism for allowing us, when the proletariat seizes control of the means of production, to produce use-values as effortlessly as possible (even if today that means periodically throwing people into unemployment with every advance of technology). This leads us to another point:

**Workers are not 'entitled' to the 'full value of their labor', and socialism is not 'when workers own the means of production'**

Socialism proceeds not from the question of distribution, as we have already noted, or from its superstructural manifestation in the form of the question of historical right. We proceed from the facts of modern production. This demand is that of a doomed petty-bourgeoisie, who imagine all will be well when they redistribute property among themselves and return to an imagined utopia of simple commodity production and exchange. First, one can only imagine that just as simple commodity production and exchange logically precedes generalized commodity production and exchange, this utopia would quickly return to what it had just set out to overturn. Competition would continue to serve as a mechanism through which some capitals may be enlarged, others vanquished, and a proletariat would mysteriously reappear once more. Secondly, if the surplus product hypothetically belonged to those who produced it, and they produced it as isolated units, society itself would cease to exist: how else could doctors and teachers be paid, if not out of this surplus? How could we care for the young and the old? Marx and Engels deal with this nonsense with reference to Proudhon and Dühring.

But this is taking this all too seriously. Production is so far advanced that to imagine it could be converted into isolated units operating at the scale of a single individual or even a family is a delusional fantasy. What are you reading this on? A computer? A cell phone? Consider the manner in which it was produced. Where are you reading it? In a house? On a train? Consider the manner in which this was produced. Consider all the material necessary, and all the corners of the globe it comes from. Consider what was necessary for a single node within the vast supply chain to exist: all the capital accumulated prior, and so on. This is impossible to reverse, and socialists have no intention of doing so. We will instead realize for the first time what is latent in this development; and what socialism is, rather, is production and distribution based on the criterion of use-value as opposed to profitability. This is not arbitrary but called forth by necessity from the contradiction between the relations and forces of production (private profit existing illogically alongside socialized production). To consider this point more broadly,

**Socialists do not reject the world 'as it is' and seek to erect something else in its place**

Here's the kicker: we do not look upon the world with disgust, imagining ourselves to be outside of it and morally above it. Historical materialism asserts that the very condition for doing so is that capitalism has outworn its historical rationality; the origin of this must be sought, not in the contingent ways in which it is reflected in our consciousness, but in production itself. The paradox of dialectics is that it is precisely its conservatism which is revolutionary. Our future, that which will be, is to be sought in that which is. And just as we may look with disgust upon the enclosure acts, the de-skilling of labor, the poverty and disease associated with urbanization, colonization and so on, i.e., all the events necessary for the constitution of a proletariat, it is precisely these acts which contain the germ of the future. We don't suffer from the delusion that we have ""the answer to the world's problems"", but rather we take a side, as partisans, in a class struggle which predated us, and our political efforts are directed towards illuminating what is really at stake in this struggle. Socialism is not an idea we introduce from without, it rather was posited by capitalism itself and is merely something which we cast a light upon, to paraphrase Marx's letter to Ruge.

If there was *anything* at all in this post that you find objectionable, I believe that given this post is concerned with 'the basics' of a Marxist world-view I would be justified in saying that you need to go back to the basics. But that's quite okay; there is nothing wrong with this and you should not take it as an insult. Let's use an analogy: the difference between a good and a great athlete is that the great one continues to practice what the good player already thinks he had mastered. It is true that Marx's *Capital* is not the same thing as Engels' *Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy*, just as it is true that the Gotha Programme is not the same thing as Proudhon's banking scheme or the illusions of the feudal socialists. But the essence of the matter under consideration has not changed, so the corresponding theoretical 'lens' used to make sense of the matter has not changed. And yet, at the same time, every further development of what appears to be a mere repeat of the past allows us to deepen our understanding of what we thought we had already understood. There is no analysis of social imperialism in the initial analysis of the Bernsteinian revisionists/Economists/Millerandists (in fact, it was a development to even unite these three trends together under one heading - opportunism). There is no analysis of fascism in Lenin's analysis of social-imperialism. But can we speak of Bernstein's polemics without reference to the events of 1914? Can we refer to the events of 1914 without reference to the German counter-revolution and fascism? The facts of life change, the theory we used to make sense of them is in essence the same, and yet at the same time the theory has been deepened. There is no shame in returning to this problem; Lenin, for instance, found himself referencing Marx's journalistic activity in 1847-1848 both at the dawn of his political life (*Two Tactics*) and at the maturity of this life (*State and the Revolution*), drawing a more profound lesson from it later on, just as Marx himself rethought this activity during his writings on French politics and drew a more profound lesson as the years rolled by. There's a lot more that could be written, like on the topic of 'vanguard parties' and what 'vanguard of the revolution' means. There's a thousand myths that are in need of shattering, but this is hopefully a start for the less experienced members of this sub.",8795340433800,0
433,dd7j53,"Stalin's plan to create a ""non-dollar"" common market (a new Soviet world reserve currency) to stop the rise of the US dollar and how the plan was abandoned by Khrushchev.","The Soviet monetary system stood the test of war. Thus, the money supply in Germany during the war years increased 6 times (although the Germans brought goods from all over Europe and a large part of the USSR); in Italy - 10 times; in Japan - 11 times. In the USSR, the money supply during the war years increased only 3.8 times.

However, the Great Patriotic War gave rise to a number of negative phenomena that needed to be eliminated. Firstly, there is a mismatch between the amount of money and the needs of trade. There was a surplus of money. Secondly, several types of prices have appeared - rations, commercial and market. This undermined the importance of cash wages and cash incomes of collective farmers by workdays. Thirdly, large sums of money settled with speculators. Moreover, the difference in prices still gave them the opportunity to enrich themselves at the expense of the population. This undermined social justice in the country.

The state immediately after the end of the war held a series of measures aimed at strengthening the monetary system and increasing the welfare of the population. The purchasing demand of the population increased by increasing wage funds and reducing payments to the financial system. So, from August 1945, they began to abolish the military tax on workers and employees. The tax was finally abolished in early 1946. They did not conduct monetary and clothing lotteries anymore and reduced the size of the subscription for a new state loan. In the spring of 1946, savings banks began to pay workers and employees compensation for vacations not used during the war. The post-war restructuring of industry began. There was some growth in the commodity stock due to the restructuring of industry and due to a reduction in the consumption of the armed forces and the sale of trophies. To withdraw money from circulation, the deployment of commercial trade continued. In 1946, commercial trade gained a fairly wide scope: a wide network of shops and restaurants was created, the range of goods was expanded and their price was reduced. The end of the war led to a drop in prices on collective farm markets (by more than a third).

However, by the end of 1946, the negative phenomena were not completely eliminated. Therefore, the course on monetary reform has been maintained. In addition, the release of new money and the exchange of old money for new was necessary in order to eliminate the money that went abroad and improve the quality of banknotes.

According to the USSR People’s Commissar of Finance Arseny Zverev (who managed the finances of the USSR since 1938), Stalin first inquired about the possibility of monetary reform at the end of December 1942 and demanded that the first calculations be presented at the beginning of 1943. Initially, they planned to carry out the monetary reform in 1946. However, because of the famine caused by drought and crop failure in a number of Soviet regions, the start of the reform had to be postponed. Only on December 3, 1947 did the Politburo of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks decide to abolish the card system and begin monetary reform.

The conditions for monetary reform were defined in the Decree of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks of December 14, 1947. Money exchange was carried out throughout the Soviet Union from December 16 to 22, 1947, and in remote areas ended on December 29. When recalculating wages, money was exchanged so that wages remained unchanged. The change coin was not subject to exchange and remained in circulation at face value. For cash deposits with Sberbank, amounts up to 3 thousand rubles were also subject to a one-to-one exchange; on deposits from 3 to 10 thousand rubles, savings were reduced by one third of the amount; for deposits of more than 10 thousand rubles, two thirds of the amount were subject to withdrawal. Those citizens who kept large amounts of money at home could exchange at the rate of 1 new ruble to 10 old. Relatively favorable conditions for the exchange of cash accumulations were established for holders of bonds of state loans: bonds of a loan in 1947 were not subject to revaluation; bonds of mass loans were exchanged for bonds of a new loan in the ratio of 3: 1, bonds of a freely sold loan of 1938 were exchanged in the ratio of 5: 1. Funds that were in the settlement and current accounts of cooperative organizations and collective farms were revalued from the calculation of 5 old rubles to 4 new ones.

At the same time, the government abolished the card system (earlier than other victorious states), high prices in commercial trade and introduced uniform lower state retail prices for food and industrial goods. So, for bread and flour prices were reduced by an average of 12% against the current ration prices; for cereals and pasta - by 10%, etc.

Thus, the negative consequences of the war in the monetary system were eliminated in the USSR. This allowed us to switch to trading at uniform prices and reduce the money supply by more than three times (from 43.6 to 14 billion rubles). In general, the reform was successful.

In addition, the reform had a social aspect. Speculators pressed. This restored social justice, trampled during the years of war. At first glance, it seemed that everyone was hurt, because everyone had some money on hand on December 15th. But an ordinary worker and employee living on a salary, who by the middle of the month was no longer a lot of money, suffered only nominally. He didn’t even have money left, since on December 16 they began to issue salaries with new money for the first half of the month, which they usually did not. Salaries are usually paid monthly after the end of the month. Thanks to this extradition, workers were provided with new money at the beginning of the reform. The exchange of 3 thousand rubles of a 1: 1 deposit satisfied the vast majority of the population, since people did not have significant funds. Based on the entire adult population, the average contribution to the savings book could not be more than 200 rubles. It is clear that the “Stakhanovites”, inventors and other small groups of the population who had super-profits lost some of their money with speculators. But taking into account the general decline in prices, they, without winning, nevertheless did not suffer much. True, those who kept large amounts of money at home could be unhappy. This concerned speculative groups of the population and part of the population of the South Caucasus and Central Asia who did not know the war and for this reason had the opportunity to trade. who kept large amounts of money at home. This concerned speculative groups of the population and part of the population of the South Caucasus and Central Asia who did not know the war and for this reason had the opportunity to trade. who kept large amounts of money at home. 

It should be noted that the Stalinist system was unique, which was able to withdraw most of the money from money circulation, and at the same time most ordinary people were not injured. At the same time, the whole world was struck by the fact that only two years after the end of the war and after a crop failure in 1946, the main food prices were kept at the ration level or even reduced. That is, almost all food was available to everyone in the USSR.

This was a surprise for the Western world and an offensive surprise. The capitalist system was literally driven into the mud by the ears. Thus, Great Britain, on the territory of which there was no war for four years and which suffered immeasurably less in the war than the USSR, could not cancel the card system in the early 1950s. At that time, miners went on strike in the former ""workshop of the world,"" which demanded that they provide a standard of living like the miners of the USSR.

**How Stalin freed the ruble from the dollar**

The Soviet ruble has been pegged to the US dollar since 1937. The ruble was calculated against foreign currencies based on the US dollar. In February 1950, the Central Statistical Office of the USSR, on an urgent assignment of I. Stalin, recounted the exchange rate of the new ruble. Soviet specialists, focusing on the purchasing power of the ruble and the dollar (compared the prices of goods), and brought out the figure of 14 rubles for 1 dollar. Earlier (until 1947), 53 rubles were given per dollar. However, according to the head of the Ministry of Finance Zverev and the head of Gosplan Saburov, as well as those present at the event, Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai and Albanian leader Enver Khoji, Stalin crossed this figure on February 27 and wrote: “At most - 4 rubles.”

Decree of the Council of Ministers of the USSR of February 28, 1950 transferred the ruble to a permanent gold basis, the pegging to the dollar was canceled. The gold content of the ruble was set at 0.222168 grams of pure gold. On March 1, 1950, the purchase price of the USSR State Bank for gold was set at 4 rubles. 45 kopecks for 1 gram of pure gold. As Stalin noted, the USSR was thus protected from the dollar. After the war, the United States had dollar surpluses that they wanted to dump on other countries, shifting their financial problems to others. Joseph Stalin cited Yugoslavia, where Josip Broz Tito ruled, as an example of perpetual financial, and therefore political dependence on the Western world. The Yugoslav currency was pegged to the “basket” of the US dollar and British pound sterling. Stalin actually predicted the future of Yugoslavia: ""... sooner or later, the West will"" collapse ""Yugoslavia economically and politically dismember ..."". His prophetic words have come true since the 1990s.

For the first time, national money was exempted from the American dollar. According to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, the United Nations European and Far Eastern Commissions (1952-1954), Stalin’s decision almost doubled the efficiency of Soviet exports. And at that time - industrial and high-tech. This happened due to exemption from dollar prices of importing countries that underestimated prices for Soviet exports. In turn, this led to an increase in production in most Soviet industries. The Soviet Union also got the opportunity to get rid of the import of technology from the United States and other countries that were oriented to the dollar and accelerate its own technological update.

**Stalin's plan to create a common ""non-dollar"" market The transfer to the “Stalinist gold ruble” of most of the USSR’s trade with the countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), created in 1949, as well as with China, Mongolia, North Korea, Vietnam and a number of developing countries led to the formation of a financial and economic block. There was a common market that was free of the dollar, which means political influence of the United States.**

In the first half of April 1952, an international economic meeting was held in Moscow. At it, the Soviet delegation, headed by Deputy Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers Shepilov, proposed the establishment of a common market for goods, services and capital investments. It was free of the US dollar and was created in opposition to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and US expansion. At that time, the Marshall Plan was already in full force. The economies of most of Europe are dependent on the United States.

Members of CMEA and China as early as 1951 declared the inevitability of close cooperation of all countries that do not want to subordinate the US dollar and the dictates of Western financial and trade structures. The idea was supported by countries such as Afghanistan, Iran, India, Indonesia, Yemen, Syria, Ethiopia, Yugoslavia and Uruguay. These countries became co-organizers of the Moscow Forum. Interestingly, the proposal was supported by some Western countries - Sweden, Finland, Ireland, Iceland and Austria. In total, 49 countries took part in the Moscow meeting. During his work, more than 60 trade, investment and scientific-technical agreements were signed. Among the basic principles of these agreements were: the exclusion of dollar payments; the possibility of barter, including for paying off debts; harmonization of policies in international economic organizations and in the global market; mutual favored nation treatment in loans, investments, loans and scientific and technical cooperation; customs and price privileges for developing countries (or their individual goods), etc.

The Soviet delegation proposed at the first stage to conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on customs, price, credit and commodity issues. Then they planned to carry out a gradual unification of the principles of foreign economic policy and create a “general block” trade zone. At the final stage, they planned to create an interstate settlement currency with mandatory gold content (the ruble was already prepared for this), which led to the completion of the creation of a common market. It is clear that financial and economic integration led to political integration. Around the USSR, not only socialist, but also people's democratic and former colonies, that is, developing states, would unite.

**Unfortunately, after the death of Stalin, the authorities of the USSR and most other CMEA countries departed from the proposals of the great leader, gradually falling under the power of the dollar (and their elites under the power of the ""golden calf""). They tried to “forget” about the great Stalin project. Moreover, in view of Khrushchev’s socio-economic and political adventures (“Khrushchevschina” as the first perestroika), the “Stalin gold ruble” (10 times) had to be greatly devalued and its gold content reduced. In the late 1970s, the gold content of the Soviet ruble was de facto eliminated altogether. Since the time of Khrushchev, Soviet foreign trade with most countries began to be carried out in US dollars. In addition, the Soviet Union became a ""donor"" of developing countries and began to supply the Western world with cheap energy and industrial raw materials. And the gold reserve that was created under Stalin,**

**I. Stalin understood that the world financial circles, and above all the United States, would not calmly observe the process of creating an alternative world currency, secured by gold and not tied to the dollar, and would seek a variety of methods of counteraction. But how to weaken the USSR, and not give the opportunity to appear the golden ruble? Impose a war on the USSR on foreign territory. And so it happened in Korea in 1950. On June 25, 1950, the Korean War began. The results of the war for the United States: more than 1 million dead, wounded and prisoners, a huge amount of lost military equipment and weapons, $ 20 billion of funds spent. However, the main goal of the United States was achieved, which they simply don’t know about right now, or prefer not to talk, because in the midst of the Russian intelligentsia, it’s not customary to talk badly about America.**

**The United States had a strategic goal: To prevent the USSR from introducing an alternative to the dollar, gold interstate currency.**

**After the end of the war in Korea, China, North Korea, Mongolia, and Vietnam planned to join CMEA. But the Korean war ended after the death of Stalin, and the new leadership of the USSR and the CPSU, and personally N. S. Khrushchev, changed their economic orientation to pro-Western. N.S. Khrushchev, having come to power, made it clear to everyone that the idea of ​​an interstate gold ruble was untimely. And he returned the peg of the ruble to the dollar.**

**Reforming his agriculture, banning gardens and household plots, and fighting religion (he even promised ""... to show the world the last priest ..""), he received punishment for drought and crop failures in the country. And he began to buy grain for gold on the American continent. In just a few years, N.S. Khrushchev managed to sell abroad 2,900 tons of gold (the only case in world history!) Accumulated by I. Stalin, and which were supposed to provide the gold content of the planned gold international currency - the Stalin Golden Ruble.**

**If not for the sale of gold abroad, the gold reserve of our country in 1964 would be at least about 3150 tons.**

**About the same gold reserve in 2010 has the entire IMF - the International Monetary Fund. For comparison: the US state gold reserve stored in the United States is - 8133.5 tons.**

The idea of ​​“Soviet globalization” at the financial and economic level and freedom from the US dollar, depending on the US Federal Reserve System, is now more relevant than ever. Actually, nothing needs to be invented. Everything has already been given to Russia by Joseph Stalin. It is only necessary to show political will and bring its plans to its logical conclusion. Then Russia will be completely independent on the financial and economic priority, undermine the power of the Fed, Western TNBs and TNCs and receive a powerful tool for ""Russian globalization."" Russia will receive a powerful tool for the development of the national economy and the development of the welfare of the people.

437,d6b7fw,An article debunking Steven Pinker and Bill Gate's bullshit about decreasing global poverty.,"Last week, as world leaders and business elites arrived in Davos for the World Economic Forum, Bill Gates tweeted an infographic to his 46 million followers showing that the world has been getting better and better. “This is one of my favourite infographics,” he wrote. “A lot of people underestimate just how much life has improved over the past two centuries.”

Of the six graphs – developed by Max Roser of Our World in Data – the first has attracted the most attention by far. It shows that the proportion of people living in poverty has declined from 94% in 1820 to only 10% today. The claim is simple and compelling. And it’s not just Gates who’s grabbed on to it. These figures have been trotted out in the past year by everyone from Steven Pinker to Nick Kristof and much of the rest of the Davos set to argue that the global extension of free-market capitalism has been great for everyone. Pinker and Gates have gone even further, saying we shouldn’t complain about rising inequality when the very forces that deliver such immense wealth to the richest are also eradicating poverty before our very eyes.

It’s a powerful narrative. And it’s completely wrong.

There are a number of problems with this graph, though. First of all, real data on poverty has only been collected since 1981. Anything before that is extremely sketchy, and to go back as far as 1820 is meaningless. Roser draws on a dataset that was never intended to describe poverty, but rather inequality in the distribution of world GDP – and that for only a limited range of countries. There is no actual research to bolster the claims about long-term poverty. It’s not science; it’s social media.

What Roser’s numbers actually reveal is that the world went from a situation where most of humanity had no need of money at all to one where today most of humanity struggles to survive on extremely small amounts of money. The graph casts this as a decline in poverty, but in reality what was going on was a process of dispossession that bulldozed people into the capitalist labour system, during the enclosure movements in Europe and the colonisation of the global south.

Prior to colonisation, most people lived in subsistence economies where they enjoyed access to abundant commons – land, water, forests, livestock and robust systems of sharing and reciprocity. They had little if any money, but then they didn’t need it in order to live well – so it makes little sense to claim that they were poor. This way of life was violently destroyed by colonisers who forced people off the land and into European-owned mines, factories and plantations, where they were paid paltry wages for work they never wanted to do in the first place.

In other words, Roser’s graph illustrates a story of coerced proletarianisation. It is not at all clear that this represents an improvement in people’s lives, as in most cases we know that the new income people earned from wages didn’t come anywhere close to compensating for their loss of land and resources, which were of course gobbled up by colonisers. Gates’s favourite infographic takes the violence of colonisation and repackages it as a happy story of progress.

But that’s not all that’s wrong here. The trend that the graph depicts is based on a poverty line of $1.90 (£1.44) per day, which is the equivalent of what $1.90 could buy in the US in 2011. It’s obscenely low by any standard, and we now have piles of evidence that people living just above this line have terrible levels of malnutrition and mortality. Earning $2 per day doesn’t mean that you’re somehow suddenly free of extreme poverty. Not by a long shot.

Scholars have been calling for a more reasonable poverty line for many years. Most agree that people need a minimum of about $7.40 per day to achieve basic nutrition and normal human life expectancy, plus a half-decent chance of seeing their kids survive their fifth birthday. And many scholars, including Harvard economist Lant Pritchett, insist that the poverty line should be set even higher, at $10 to $15 per day.

So what happens if we measure global poverty at the low end of this more realistic spectrum – $7.40 per day, to be extra conservative? Well, we see that the number of people living under this line has increased dramatically since measurements began in 1981, reaching some 4.2 billion people today. Suddenly the happy Davos narrative melts away.

Moreover, the few gains that have been made have virtually all happened in one place: China. It is disingenuous, then, for the likes of Gates and Pinker to claim these gains as victories for Washington-consensus neoliberalism. Take China out of the equation, and the numbers look even worse. Over the four decades since 1981, not only has the number of people in poverty gone up, the proportion of people in poverty has remained stagnant at about 60%. It would be difficult to overstate the suffering that these numbers represent.

This is a ringing indictment of our global economic system, which is failing the vast majority of humanity. Our world is richer than ever before, but virtually all of it is being captured by a small elite. Only 5% of all new income from global growth trickles down to the poorest 60% – and yet they are the people who produce most of the food and goods that the world consumes, toiling away in those factories, plantations and mines to which they were condemned 200 years ago. It is madness – and no amount of mansplaining from billionaires will be adequate to justify it.

442,je48dd,How did Bolivia voted fascism out and restored its democracy?,"I fear we will see a wave of people comparing the elections in Bolivia to other countries in America, and Bolivia might be coopted in an example of how election do work.

What differed from Bolivia's coup from the rest of the country was that Evo Morales took actions that moved beyond what other Latin countries did. Evo created power institutions on the more fundamental level of organization, neighborhoods. The Federation of Neighborhood Councils organized against the coup in 2019 and showed continuous support against imperialism. 

When the coup happened, it was rushed, there wasn't a good organization amongst other right wing forces and there was no disorganization on the MAS base. So after it happened, there was no political scenario to finish the popular organizations, like it has happened before in Argentina and Chile in the 70s.

If Lucho Arce victory is confirmed, and if MAS get major representation on both houses of parliament, the government structure will mirror the balance of forces in society for an effective popular hegemony.

It is important to note that these councils were not armed when the coup has happened and that Evo Morales has argued about the [creation of armed militia after that coup](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bolivia-evo-idUSKBN1ZC066). 

We have yet to see a popular resolution without bloodshed, at the same time it seems that not arming the population before the coup wasn't such a good idea, we also haven't seen such a quick coup be defeated by an election, which means that the American politics are more worried about its internal contradiction than to exert imperialistic power.",-3565066338683864406,0

446,d2n7rl,New Documents Show Bush Administration Planned War In Iraq Well Before 9/11/2001,"All of us knew it but couldn't prove it. Now we can prove it. Newly declassified documents published at the National Security Archive prove beyond all reasonable doubt that the Bush administration planned to topple Saddam Hussein and invade Iraq as early as January, 2001, and were making strategic plans and resource allocations as early as November, 2001.

January 30, 2001 – Bush administration principals (agency heads) meet for the
first time and discuss the Middle East, including Bush’s intention to disengage from the Israel-Palestine peace process and “How Iraq is destabilizing the region.” Bush directs Rumsfeld and JCS chairman Hugh Shelton to examine military options for Iraq; CIA director George Tenet is directed to improve intelligence on the country. Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill and counterterrorism coordinator Richard Clarke are both struck by the emphasis on confronting Iraq, an aim consistent with Rumsfeld’s hiring of Wolfowitz and later Feith, well known for their bellicosity on the issue, for high-level Pentagon
positions. (Source: EBB/Franks Timeline (PDF))

When did we invade Afghanistan? Oh, that's right...it was October 7, 2001.

Walking through these documents makes it clear that the Bush Administration -- from Day One -- intended to invade Iraq at some point in their reign of terror. Here is a memo (PDF) dated January 23, 2001 outlining the ""Origins of the Iraq Regime Change Policy"". This was requested by Vice President-elect Dick Cheney before taking office, presumably as a way to justify policy formation around aggressive US efforts for ""regime change"" in Iraq.

This memo (PDF) written on November 27, 2001 should send cold chills up and down your spine. It is a list of talking points from Rumsfeld to Franks about how to handle a run-up to a full-scale Iraq invasion. November 27th, 51 days after Afghanistan was invaded. And check this talking point:

unlike afghanistan know who will rule in iraq.jpg
Afghanistan was never, ever a priority for the Bush Administration. It was always about Iraq. To line up support for the plan, they were marshalling the Catholics and anyone else they could get to start forming arguments for ""just wars"". An internal memo from Robert Andrews, Dep. Assistant Secretary of Defense on December 17, 2001 touted this:

A prominent Catholic theologian outlines the moral justification for a pre-emptive strike against Iraq.

[...a list of reasons why it was so important follows]

Introduces the concept of ""regime factor,""
illustrates the concept using the Iraq situation
demonstrates how pre-emptive action against Iraq fits into the just-war tradition
That memo made its way to Douglas Feith, neocon extraordinaire, who left his approval in the margin:

George is a brilliant guy and a gentleman. Thanks for sending this along. DJF

Speaking strictly for me, the idea of Catholic aides to the Pope pushing wars as ""just"" to our government smacks of intervention not of the divine kind. The article itself pushes along the lie about WMD, too, reinforcing what we now know was nothing more than fantasy in the black hearts of Cheney and his neocon brigade. But it added to the political cover the Bush administration needed to push the Iraq effort forward.

Iraq, for Cheney, Bush and the crew, was a way to increase prestige and power. Nothing speaks to that louder than the oft-repeated words in this memo from Donald Rumsfeld on July 27, 2001 where he says this at least twice:

If Saddam's regime were ousted, we would have a much-improved position in the region and elsewhere.

The first time he mentions this, it's with some regret that we're not better friends with Iran. The second time he mentions it, it's in his closing argument for why toppling Saddam Hussein will strengthen US Arab-Israeli policy. It's like a talisman for Rumsfeld, this idea of improving our ""US credibility and influence throughout the region"".

Here's the punchline, courtesy of the National Security Archive summary:

At this point, the weight of evidence supports an observation made in April 2002 by members of the covert Iraq Operations Group – Iraq “regime change” was already on Bush’s agenda when he took office in January 2001. (Note 33) September 11 was not the motivation for the U.S. invasion of Iraq – it was a distraction from it.

Now, at least, our instinct about Iraq being the one true goal is confirmed. For whatever that's worth, anyway.

According to Doctor  of Science Angelina Díaz García, general director of the Center for  Advanced Studies of Cuba, this is a technological milestone that  promotes greater security in the detection of positive cases.    In an  interview with the Granma newspaper, Díaz García pointed out that this  product has high sensitivity and the ability to concentrate samples,  thus avoiding false negatives, a vital issue to cut the transmission of  COVID-19 in Cuba.

The head of the  CEA explained that the fully Cuban diagnostician was validated at the  Pedro Kourí Institute of Tropical Medicine and was granted an  Authorization for Use in Emergencies by the Center for State Control of  Medicines, Equipment and Medical Devices.    As main characteristics,  this product shows 100 percent concordance with imported kits, and does  not require a cold chain; In addition, it substitutes imports of key  resources to contain the pandemic.

Despite  the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United  States on Cuba, Cuban biotechnology has produced the essential drugs for  the care of COVID-19 in the country, including the four national  vaccine candidates, Soberana 01, Soberana 02, Mambisa and Abdala.

452,k4vbl0,Quick Guide to Debunking Death Toll Claims,"**Source:** When someone makes a Death Toll Claim, always ask for the source. In most cases the conversation would have ended here as most people who make DTCs are idiots, but in case they persist, you can make a pretty educated guess on their source depending on their DTC.

If they claim **any of the following:**

* Mao killed 65 million
* Stalin killed 15 million
* Holodomor killed 7 million
* Gulag killed 3 million
* Communism killed over 100 million

Then it is safe to assume that they got their numbers from **“Black Book of Communism,”** a book that is **despised** in the academic field. A whole book can be written about why “BBoC” is academic trash but here are some quick trivia to remember:

* Two of the book contributors renounced their association with the book.
* Harvard University retracted its publication of the book.
* The book defines “any unnatural death” concurrent to Communism as a “victim to it.”

If the DTC list **includes famine death**, but the list itself does not list **Winston Churchill’s Death Toll in the millions** (3 million based on credible sources), it is safe to assume that this list is bogus and question the OP as to why Winston Churchill, who directly caused the **Bengal Famine that killed 3 million people**, is not on the list.

How to determine whether a list included famine deaths:

* If the USSR death toll is **significantly above 1.8 million**
   * 800,000 executions throughout the entire USSR
   * About one million gulag deaths
* If the Maoist China death toll is **significantly above 400,000**
   * About 400,000 deaths in the Cultural Revolution

I decided to include the gulag deaths for USSR as they are more than simply famine, but still significantly overestimated in most scenarios.

In short, if you see that the DTC is supported either by BBoC or Famine Deaths (in most cases, both), then you have more than sufficient knowledge at this point to debunk them.

>Much of precommunist Eastern Europe, as with prerevolutionary Russia and China, was in effect a Third World region with widespread poverty and almost nonexistent capital formation. Most rural transportation was still by horse and wagon.

>The devastation of World War II added another heavy layer of misery upon the region, reducing hundreds of villages and many cities to rubble. It was the communists and their allies who rebuilt these societies. While denounced in the U.S. press for leaving their economies in bad shape, in fact, the Reds left the economy of Eastern Europe in far better condition than they found it.

>The same was true of China. Henry Rosemont, Jr. notes that when the communists liberated Shanghai from the U.S.-supported reac­tionary Kuomintang regime in 1 949, about 20 percent of that city's population, an estimated 1.2 million, were drug addicts. Every morning there were special street crews ""whose sole task was to gather up the corpses of the children, adults, and the elderly who had been murdered during the night, or had been abandoned, and died ofdisease, cold, and/or starvation"" (ZMagazine, October 1995).

>During the years of Stalin's reign, the Soviet nation made dra­matic gains in literacy, industrial wages, health care, and women's rights. These accomplishments usually go unmentioned when the
Stalinist era is discussed. To say that ""socialism doesn't work"" is to overlook the fact that it did. In Eastern Europe, Russia, China, Mongolia, North Korea, and Cuba, revolutionary communism cre­ ated a life for the mass ofpeople that was far better than the wretched existence they had endured under feudal lords, military bosses, for­ eign colonizers, and Western capitalists. The end result was a dra­ matic improvement in living conditions for hundreds of millions of people on a scale never before or since witnessed in history.

>State socialism transformed desperately poor countries into mod­ ernized societies in which everyone had enough food, clothing, and shelter; where elderly people had secure pensions; and where all chil­ dren (and many adults) went to school and no one was denied med­ ical attention. Some of us from poor families who carry around the hidden injuries of class are much impressed by these achievements and are unwilling to dismiss them as merely ""economistic.""
But what of the democratic rights that these peoples were denied?

>In fact, with the exception of Czechoslovakia, these countries had known little political democracy in the days before communism. Russia was a czarist autocracy, Poland a rightist dictatorship with concentration camps of its own, Albania an Italian fascist protec­ torate as early as 1927, Cuba a U.S.-sponsored dictatorship. Lithuania, Hungary, Rumania, and Bulgaria were outright fascist regimes allied with Nazi Germany in World War II.

>Then there were the distorting effects that unremitting capitalist encirclement had upon the building of socialism. Throughout its entire seventy-three-year history of counterrevolutionary invasion, civil war, forced industrialization, Stalinist purges and deportations, Nazi conquest, cold war, and nuclear arms race, the Soviet Union did not know one day of peaceful development. In the attempt to main­ tain military parity with the United States, the Soviets took on crush­ ing defense costs that seriously depleted their civilian economy. In addition, they faced monetary boycott, trade discrimination, and technological embargo from the West. 

>The people who lived under communism endured chronic shortages, long lines, poor quality goods and services, and many other problems. They wanted a better life, and who could blame them? Without capitalist encirclement, they would have had a better chance of solving more of their inter­nal problems.

I think it’s a damn good idea. 
Although what bothers me most is that there is no way to find this quote from his book “economic problems of socialism in USSR” by googling. I couldn’t find absolutely anything about it.
Only way to find out about this idea of his is by reading the book, anyhow, here’s the quote:

“It would be wrong to think that such a substantial advance in the cultural standard of the members of society can be brought about without substantial changes in the present status of labour. For this, it is necessary, first of all, to shorten the working day at least to six, and subsequently to five hours. This is needed in order that the members of society might have the necessary free time to receive an all round education. It is necessary, further, to introduce universal compulsory polytechnical education, which is required in order that the members of society might be able freely to choose their occupations and not be tied to some one occupation all their lives. It is likewise necessary that housing conditions should be radically improved and that real wages of workers and employees should be at least doubled, if not more, both by means of direct increases of wages and salaries, and, more especially, by further systematic reductions of prices for consumer goods.”",-7233640767133708547,0
463,e2uw1b,My professor was assistant to the man that came up with the statistic that one million Koreans died in the Arduous March,"I’m a “political science” major about to graduate from an American public university. This semester I took a class on politics in Asia and today we started Korea. To my surprise, my professor told the class that he was the assistant to [Andrew Natsios]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Natsios), the man that came up with the statistic that one million Koreans had died in the DPRK from the famine in the 90s. It turns out that Natsios was dedicated to bringing the number of total dead to one million because he figured anything less would go unnoticed. He wanted his research to be front page material on the New York Times etc.
My professor said that in order to come up with such a number, Natsios found a statistic from some monks in a village in the DPRK where 20% of the village had died as a result of the famine. Natsios of course completely trusts this source and doesn't question whether the monks had any training in demography whatsoever. Natsios goes on to multiply that percentage by the number of villages/towns in the DPRK to come up with a large enough number that could be added to his other statistics to bring the total up to one million dead.
	
The reason my professor even brought this up was because he remembers very vividly the day Natsios was finally able to justify claiming that one million had died because he was there. My professor said Natsios was an ideologically driven anti-communist dedicated to arguing that communism causes famines. When Natsios played with the numbers enough to finally reach one million, he saw Natsios gleefully jump for joy in excitement.  Natsios went around the office exclaiming that he had done it! He had proven that one million had died as a result of communism in the DPRK!
	
Just imagine being this excited to find out that one million had died in a famine. As I heard this, I immediately recognized how similar it sounded to the other famines we hear about. A disaster happens that results in vast numbers of people dyeing but instead of empathizing with the dead, the famine is politicized and used as a statistic for anti-communists. Let’s be clear here, these people don’t give a shit about those who died. They’re simply interested in using their deaths as a card to play in their fight against communism.

So, just out of curiosity I thought I'd look into the deaths caused by capitalism as we all know the 100 million. Just so for a point of reference.

It was difficult to find a whole number like in the black book of communism (where the 100 million originates from) so I looked at things like can't afford health care, food, shelter etc. Basically poverty.

So in the Lancet they estimate 5 million die because they can't afford/have access to health care  https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31668-4/fulltext
That's 150 million since 1991

For lack of food and food related diseases about 9 million die per year https://www.theworldcounts.com/challenges/people-and-poverty/hunger-and-obesity/how-many-people-die-from-hunger-each-year/story

That's 3 million since 1991. More info here. https://homelessworldcup.org/homelessness-statistics/

A site on poverty (this will include the same factors as above. So see this as a separate estimate) Says about 18 million deaths from poverty. https://windwardpoverty.weebly.com/facts--statistics.html
So that's 540 million since 1991 

I've also been looking through the IMF, World Bank, WHO, UNICEF and other UN organisations which confirm these figures to an extent. 

Now what got me was how most of these deaths are happening in countries that has had capitalism forced apon them as which they've had centuries of land, labour and resources stolen from such as Africa. Another thing that got me is that UNICEF says that by 2030 a suspected 69 million children under the age of 5 will die due to poverty, disease etc. https://www.unicef.org/media/media_91755.html

At the plant’s health clinic, 560 doctors and staff use sleek Western equipment to provide care from routine checkups to surgery, including laser eyesight correction. A Palace of Culture opposite the factory’s ornate, Stalin-era gates includes a plush theater wired for light and sound. It just hosted a concert in honor of the “Day of Machine Builders.” Outside the capital, a woodland sanatorium provides cures, vacations, and summer camps for 300 employees’ kids at a time. “They were smart professionals back then who set up these social services,” says Suslenkou, adding that he audited the system Soviet planners made for the factory and found little “excess” to cut.**

Call it the Belarus exception. Almost 28 years since the collapse of the Soviet Union, this deeply cautious nation of 9.5 million—rolled over through the centuries by Moscow’s wars with other parts of Europe—has kept alive many of the industrial jobs and social ecosystems that centrally planned factory budgets once supported across the bloc.

In the West, Belarus is probably best known as “Europe’s last dictatorship.” **Less recognized is that its transition from command to semi-market economy, delivered at the speed of a mud-bound tractor, has by some economic measures made this a better place to live than any other former Soviet republic, barring the three Baltic States that joined the European Union. Belarus scores better on inequality than any EU nation (including the likes of Denmark), and has a smaller percentage of people living on less than $5.50 per day, a World Bank measure of poverty, than any other part of what was once the Soviet Union, half of the EU’s 28 member states, or the U.S.**

**In place of the potholed roads, rundown buildings, and the depopulation found in some other struggling ex-Soviet nations, President Alexander Lukashenko, now 65 and in charge since 1994, has turned Minsk into something of a Soviet theme park. It’s a vision of how he believes things might have been without the communist empire’s 1991 collapse. Statues of Lenin and other Bolshevik heroes still dominate cityscapes. Stalin-era buildings and boulevards are immaculately maintained and painted; parks are manicured and pavements swept clean. After Lukashenko visited the tractor factory in 2015, managers restored communist-era friezes removed during the campaign against “architectural excesses” that followed Stalin’s death, in 1953.**

“I think Belarus does have a unique path,” one that has had some under-recognized benefits such as stability, says Alexander Pivovarsky, the EBRD’s country manager, in an interview at his office in central Minsk. “But we believe the economic model of Belarus is unsustainable.”

Indeed, Lukashenko’s exception is now under threat, for the same reason it would be hard for others to emulate: It was made possible by billions of dollars’ worth of de facto annual Russian energy subsidies, in the form of large quantities of crude oil which Belarus buys at a discount. Russia is withdrawing those subsidies through a so-called tax maneuver, which will eliminate an exemption that benefitted Belarus. Its refineries already pay 80% of the world price for Russian oil—up from 50% five years ago—and as a result of the tax change they will pay full price by 2025, at a cost, says the government, of $10 billion over those six years. (Belarus also pays as little as half as much as Western European countries for Russian natural gas. Negotiations to continue that discount are ongoing.)

Without compensation for these lost subsidies, Belarus may have to restructure its legacy state-owned factories, losing many of the jobs and welfare systems they sustain. “What you have to remember is that Belarus is an oil economy. It doesn’t look like an oil exporter, but it is, because all the time it has been getting cheap oil from Russia,” which it then refines for re-export to Europe, says Sergei Guriev, a former chief economist for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. “That’s about to change, and we have this hour of reckoning.”

The Kremlin is making any compensation to soften the blow contingent on a deal to integrate the two countries. That’s forcing Lukashenko to navigate a choice he has long sought to avoid: Cut a deal with Russia, at the risk of being seen to sacrifice sovereignty, or put the nation’s heavy industry on a commercial footing and turn westward for support, risking retribution from Moscow. An agreement resulting from months of intense negotiations is due to be signed on Dec. 8.

**Until now, Lukashenko has managed dealings with Russia in a way that other ex-Republics have been unable to achieve. In part thanks to the resulting stability, Belarus’s per capita gross domestic product is, in U.S. dollar terms, about twice as high as in fellow ex-republics Georgia, Moldova, or Ukraine. Those three countries have experimented more with market economics, democracy, and a pro-European direction, which brought clashes with Moscow. Instead of cheap energy, they got Russian sanctions, political interference, and territorial dismemberment. The price Belarusians have had to pay for that stability, in terms of lost human rights protections and political freedoms, has been exorbitant. The domestic security service is still called the KGB. A 2018 United Nations report cited abuses that ranged from police torture to restrictions on the freedom of expression.**

**Yet a lot has changed since Belarusians voted in a referendum to keep the Soviet Union intact by a margin of 84% to 16%, shortly before it collapsed in 1991. On coming to power, Lukashenko, a former collective farm director, took advantage of that nostalgia to turn the clock back on liberal reforms made in the aftermath of the Soviet collapse. Among other measures, he abolished some direct local elections, limited the right to buy and sell farmland and restored Russian as an official language. He also moved Independence Day to mark the Soviet liberation of Minsk from Nazi occupation, in 1944, instead of Belarus’s 1990 declaration of sovereignty from the Soviet Union.**

He wasn’t shy about his views on private enterprise, either. “In 10 years, I’ll shake the hand of the last entrepreneur,” he said in 1995, according to local media reports. “Entrepreneurs are lousy fleas, there is no need for them!” Four years later, he signed a deal with Russia to merge the two countries’ political and economic institutions to form a partially reunified state that he seemed—in the days before Vladimir Putin took over in Moscow—a viable candidate to head.

Today, Lukashenko pins medals on entrepreneurs’ chests and casts himself as defender of Belarus sovereignty. About 50% of the economy is in private hands. In downtown Minsk, numerous bars, restaurants, and private shops have sprung up among the city’s Stalin-era buildings and the sprinkling of stores that still advertise their wares, Soviet-style, as just “Shoes,” “Books,” or “Groceries.” And for all his reluctance to privatize big, state-owned employers, Lukashenko has used targeted tax breaks and regulatory dispensations to encourage the growth of a vibrant private tech sector. This has helped produce the makers of the global hit video game World of Tanks, as well as IT outsourcing company Epam Systems Inc., listed on the New York Stock Exchange with a market cap of more than $11 billion.

“These are real success stories,’’ says Guriev, now a professor of economics at Sciences Po, the Paris Institute of Political Studies. Still, both tech companies moved their headquarters out of the country as soon as they grew big—Epam to New York and Wargaming Group Ltd. to Cyprus. “Entrepreneurs are not protected from the KGB,” Guriev says.

**What made Belarus different from its neighbors was Lukashenko’s refusal to privatize the economy in the 1990s, preventing the emergence of the powerful so-called oligarchs who snapped up vast state assets in Ukraine and Russia, according to Pavel Daneyko, director general of the IPM Business School in Minsk. Rather than acquire Soviet-rooted companies like the Minsk tractor factory, known as MTZ, would-be entrepreneurs in Belarus had to build businesses from scratch in greenfield sectors such as IT and retail. The owner of a chain of supermarkets, Eurotorg LLC, now claims to be the nation’s largest private company by number of employees.**

For a long time, Lukashenko’s hostility to private enterprise made that development difficult. “In 2005, the KGB told me to leave the country for a couple of years,” says Daneyko. The business school he ran at the time was being forced to close. “I went to Moscow, and I thought Russia was a kind of paradise for business, compared to Belarus,” he says. With the emergence of a relatively benign, oligarch-free, if limited form of capitalism, Belarus has, according to Daneyko, turned the tables.

Belarusians are no longer as keen as they once were to be ruled from Moscow. A recent opinion survey by the non-government polling agency BAW found that 75.6% of respondents wanted Belarus and Russia to remain independent, friendly states. Even as it tries to limit the coming deal with the Kremlin to economic integration, the government is also trying to sign a trade agreement with the EU and to boost trade and investment ties with China. “Belarus has always acutely sensed the breath of the geopolitical wind,” Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei said, during an October conference in Minsk. “Recently, we have been living under constant storm alert.”

The problem for Belarus is that “while they have achieved the impossible—preserving all the advantages they had—so that they now have a future,” that strategy has left the country dependent on Russia to an extent that trade data underestimate, says Vasily Kashin, a defense specialist and senior research fellow in Moscow’s Higher School of Economics.

For example, MTZ exports more than 90% of the 32,000 tractors it makes every year, with Russia—by far the largest market—buying about a third of them. Belarus’s other big machinery plants are at least as dependent. A quarter of exports to Europe, meanwhile, are petroleum products, dependent on discounted crude coming from Moscow. “Russia could shut them all down within months; the economy would collapse,” says Kashin.

Belarus’s burgeoning tech sector, in part a legacy of the country’s specialization in producing the electronics at the smart end of the Soviet military machine, is far less Russia-dependent. The government offers tax and regulatory relief to companies accepted into a virtual Hi-Tech Park; that help is essential precisely because the competition is global and comes from the likes of India, as well as Russia, Europe, and the U.S., says Yury Pliashkou, founder and chief executive of IdeaSoft, a small IT outsourcing company in Minsk.

Tech, however, isn’t enough. The economy as a whole has grown at a snail’s pace since the global financial crisis (an average 1.7% per annum since 2009, compared to 7.5% over the previous decade). According to one estimate, that slide has coincided with a drop in Russian energy subsidies to between 5% and 10% of Belarus’s GDP, from a pre-crisis high of 20% of GDP. A top official at state oil company Belneftekhim said at the end of October that Belarus refineries lost $250 million over the first nine months of this year, a result of the latest changes to Russia’s tax code.

The government has been racking up debt to keep its economic model afloat. The economy has also begun to look less egalitarian, with wealth concentrating in tech-heavy Minsk as most other regions fall behind. The International Monetary Fund forecasts that unless Lukashenko can secure compensation from Moscow, the change to Russia’s tax rules for its energy companies will cost the country a further 5.2% of its annual $60 billion GDP by 2023. The solution, according to the fund: Either restructure, privatize, or close those big, legacy Soviet factories to cut government spending on subsidies, much as was done elsewhere during the 1990s.

“We are moving to liberalize, but gradually, we are not going to do it in a shock manner,” says Anatoly Glaz, spokesman for the foreign ministry. “You see the situation in a number of countries, including those near us; social stability is important to us.” Glaz also pushed back against the whole concept of Russian subsidies, arguing that Moscow is obliged to sell energy to Belarusian companies at the same price as to Russian ones under the integrated market rules of the Eurasian Economic Union, to which both countries belong. “It is not a subsidy, it is a question of equality, of equal prices. They can even be world prices, but they must be the same, otherwise we cannot compete in the same market.”

**On the production line back at MTZ, workers currently assemble 120 models and modifications of tractors, up from four in the Soviet days, from tiny 8-horsepower machines to 350-horsepower, computer aided monsters that can cost upward of $120,000. Computers allocate the required parts and operate the 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) of conveyor belts that supply production lines. It’s a commercial operation now, says Suslenkou, as paying tourists file into the main production hall before moving on to a gut-wrenching, strap-in tractor race simulator and finally, a gift shop selling everything from toy tractors to a branded ax. As for worker benefits, “we’ve noticed that the companies that closed their social services are the ones that are now having trouble retaining workers,” he says. The medical clinic alone costs MTZ $4 million a year to run, according to its chief doctor.**

**Published annual accounts suggest MTZ turns a profit. If that’s accurate, it’s likely thanks to a basic $12,000-$14,000 tractor model that remains popular across the former Soviet Union, Africa, and Asia because it’s inexpensive and simple enough for farmers to fix themselves. Others among Belarus’s legacy industries have struggled harder to keep markets or find new ones.**

Daneyko, the business school director, was recently hired to advise on a turnaround plan for one of these, the state-owned combine harvester maker OSJC Gomselmash. Restructuring such ex-Soviet behemoths, he says, will inevitably lead to privatization. And with that could come the end of Lukashenko’s post-Soviet dream.

498,c85arm,"Detained migrants being told to 'drink out of toilets'- including 15 mothers, including toddlers.","Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Monday described the abysmal conditions she and other members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and other House Democrats saw after visiting two immigration detention facilities in Texas, and said she'd learned that Customs and Border Patrol officers told detained women to ""drink out of the toilets.""

“After I forced myself into a cell w/ women & began speaking to them, one of them described their treatment at the hands of officers as ‘psychological warfare’ — waking them at odd hours for no reason, calling them wh*res, etc.,” she wrote. “Tell me what about that is due to a “lack of funding?”

Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., was part of a delegation of more than a dozen House members who toured two centers in El Paso and Clint, Texas.

""We came today and we saw that the system is still broken,"" said Rep. Joaquín Castro, D-Texas, who chairs the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, at a press conference after their tour. ""These are the conditions that have been created by the Trump administration. These are the inhumane conditions that folks are facing,"" he said, as he and the other lawmakers were trying to speak above the din of hecklers shouting, ""America First!""

Rep. Marc Veasey, also from Texas, wrote on Twitter, ""we found children barely older than toddlers in cells; families that had been separated from one another; holding centers that were little more than animal sheds, with chainlink fences and pad-locks used to lock up men, women, and children.""

The congressional members' tweets and comments to reporters came hours after Pro Publica reported that 9,500 Customs and Border Patrol agents had participated in a Facebook group replete with jokes about migrant deaths and sexist comments about lawmakers, including Ocasio-Cortez. NBC News has not independently verified this Facebook group and has not seen the posts.

“I see why CBP officers were being so physically and sexually threatening towards me,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter. “Officers were keeping women in cells w/ no water & had told them to drink out of the toilets.”

“This was them on their GOOD behavior in front of members of Congress,” she added.

Castro, who told reporters that the Pro Publica report ""shocks the conscience that these agents are entrusted with the lives of anybody in their custody,"" corroborated Ocasio-Cortez's tweets, stating that the group encountered a group of around 15 mothers — some of whom had been housed in the facility for more than 50 days — living in ""indefensible"" conditions.

502,dqrspr,"Chinese ""Imperialism""","As a Latin comrade, I am so freaking sick of leftists accusing the Chinese government of ""imperialism."" My countries suffered tremendously fucked up imperialist neo-colonial bullshit and leftist feel it is quiet adequate to categorize China like that??

Tell me:


- What Chinese companies mandated their government to assassinate their president or candidates?


- What country did the Chinese army invade to extract their natural resources?


- What Chinese company toppled government after government that were not aligned with their interest?


- Which election did the Chinese government manipulate to put their people in power?


- How many death squads or paramilitary armies did the CPC sponsor?

**Response 1: But comrade, they are in Africa investing in some companies with bad labor practices, and they are extracting their natural resources!**

I know. There are many things China can improve with their foreign investment plans, but is this imperialism? Is this the murderous conquistadors or CEOs that topple a people to extract and exploit for the sake of profit? Or are they treating them as equal trading partners, but not yet directing them to having better labor standards for their workers in their own countries? 

Again, I recognize there are issues with more indigenous populations, and this is not to make light of their plight. I do think China, with their economic pull, can make significant changes and demands before investing to change such treatment. But this isn't fucking chopping off hands with machetes or killing families of workers/activists type shit that Western multinationals funded, supported, or actually did. **Imperialism is some serious crimes of humanity that should not be haphazardly thrown around without critical analysis.**

**Response 2: But comrade, they are investing in Africa's infrastructure and giving them loans so they are always beholden to them.**

Again, this is not imperialism like the West did. [During the banana republic era, American businesses took over to develop the infrastructure of entire countries, but they were only build to surround their business, not to benefit the people](https://youtu.be/QgydTdThoeA?t=153). I highly recommend watching the entire video to see the fucked up shit that these companies **that are still in business** did and are still doing. 

China is actually given money and investments to the governments of these countries to invest them back to the people, not Chinese CEOs. In fact, [specifically on their ""loans"", most of them given to African government have been forgiven, to a point where Westerns are saying they should have ""lender's remorse"" for trying to give them so much money](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3022301/lenders-remorse-china-finds-africa-projects-require-growing).

> Ethiopia, China’s second-largest African borrower after Angola, also received relief when Beijing extended the repayment period from 10 years to 30 years for a US$3.3 billion loan it had taken on to build its Addis-Djibouti railway line.

> **4 other African countries**

> This year, China cancelled Cameroon’s US$78 million debt. Last year, it wrote off Botswana’s US$7.2 million debt and US$10.6 million that Lesotho owed. In 2017, it cancelled US$160 million of debts owed by Sudan.

> China's efforts in Congo helped unlock $400million + of IMF funding

> And the recent deal to restructure debt owed by the Republic of Congo helped unlock US$449 million from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The central African nation’s troubles can be traced to mid-2014 when, because of global oversupply, crude oil prices fell from a high of US$100 per barrel to as low as US$30. Oil sales account for more than 70 per cent of the government’s revenues.

> Chinese international cooperation with African countries and international institutions - IMF

> However, debt levels soared to 118 per cent of Congo’s annual economic output by 2017. With a deep hole in the country’s finances, it was China that stepped in to help. China holds more than a third or US$2.5 billion of the Congolese debt, which stands at about US$9 billion. Since 2017, the Republic of Congo has been trying to get financing from the IMF to revive its economy. The IMF demanded that the country restructure its Chinese debt as a precondition for a three-year extended credit facility programme. China’s decision to restructure the debt is in response to the IMF demand.

> Zambia, Angola, Mozambique and Djibouti are said to be currently engaged in similar negotiations with China.

His grandmother got ill and that drove his family into poverty. His parents left him and ran away. He went to Chengdu to work but was heavily exploited by the greedy boss. People on the Internet funded and supported him. But when he found he had got a tumour on his nose and had caught the DM, he ran out of money and died of ketoacidosis.

On the 26th of December of last year, which was the 127th birthday of Chairman Mao, he posted a quotation from Chairman Mao to memorize the passed leader of the people. In his another account which has been blocked possibly for his comments defending the Maoist Era and attacking the government, videos promoting Maoism and the October Revolution were uploaded.

The left mourn his death and question the government's so-called fupin programme which aims at lifting the poor from poverty, while some pro-government nationalists attack the dead Vtuber to be a liar and question his personality. The Ruguanists claim his death to be due to 'American Imperialist Exploitation' and call for war on the US. Pro-western liberals ridicule at his support for Maoism.

Our world order offers basically no other semblance of democracy than bourgeois elections. As such, the people can feel otherwise disempowered and discouraged. Not everyone has read Lenin’s Imperialism or State and Rev.

The situation in the states is far worse than in my Ireland, for example. I can only attempt to empathise with what Americans comrades are feeling. 

So

TL;DR - yes it is fun to dunk on liberals but have empathy for the fear they might be feeling and how they may feel they have no other outlet than the voting booth.

Full text is at [Rodong Sinmun](https://rodong.rep.kp/en/index.php?strPageID=SF01_02_01&newsID=2021-02-12-0002), or the more stable servers provided by the liberals at [""kcnawatch""](https://kcnawatch.org/newstream/1613115057-34701475/let-us-adorn-first-years-advance-for-implementing-decisions-made-at-party-congress-with-proud-innovation-and-progress-report-on-2nd-plenary-meeting-of-8th-central-committee-of-wpk/).

This meeting was convened to examine the work of the economic planning organs in fulfilling the tasks set by the 8th Congress of the Worker's Party of Korea earlier this year. That Congress had the same themes as this meeting, but here see much more specific details of the criticisms directed at officials. 

All of this, along with the election of Kim Jong-un to the same position once held by Kim Jong-il, seems to indicate that a strong anti-revisionist line within the Worker's Party of Korea has firmly coalesced around Kim Jong-un and is taking steps to revitalise Korean socialism by removing the crud accumulated during the vicissitudes of the whole period from the 1980s to the present (and especially the extreme difficulties of the 90s).

As expected from Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism the chief emphasis is on ideological struggle and attempting to reinvigorate the revolutionary spirit of wayward officials. But there's also a threat presented: if they don't perform, they will be severely punished for betraying the Party and the people.

It continues to be interesting to watch Korea and see how this all develops, because it is extremely promising so far.

**Economic planning**

>The Cabinet failed to play a leading role in mapping out plans of key economic fields and almost mechanically brought together the numbers drafted by the ministries. And as a result, the plan of one field has been raised subjectively even there is no actual possibility and the plans of other fields have been lowered under the signboard of readjusting and reinforcing even there are tasks that can certainly be accomplished or must be fulfilled.

>The report sharply criticized the work of several fields that markedly showed such tendencies.

>In the field of agriculture, the goal for grain production has been set high subjectively from the first year of the five-year plan irrespective of present situation where farming condition is unfavorable and the state is unable to supply enough farming materials, thereby making it hard to avoid bureaucracy and bragging from the planning stage just as before.

>In contrast with this, the fields of electric power industry, construction and light industry have brought down the production plans for major indices to the level where they would not be blamed in the year-end.

>Now major industrial establishments in the fields of metal, chemical and machine industries, local-industry factories across the country and the agricultural field raise the demand for even a bit more electricity, coal and other mines can not but stop production due to electricity and the people feel inconvenience in their living.

>This being a fact, the Cabinet, the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Electric Power Industry mapped out this year's plan for producing electricity lower than the present level under the pretext of adjusting to the present demand on electricity of major industrial establishments and directing efforts to restoring original efficiency of electric generators.

...

>The light industry sector was also seriously censured for mapping out an absurdly low plan for this year's shoes production under the excuse of materials provision and giving priority to quality over quantity.

>The report stressed the need for other sectors to suggest goals, which can make tangible contribution to economic construction and people's living, with purposefulness of development, dynamism, perseverance and scientific accuracy, far from setting plan low so as to get appraisal of over-fulfilling task at the year-end.

...

>Stressing that the nationwide, planned and scientific self-reliance should be given special priority and applied innovatively in economic work, the report said that this year's plan mentions about preferentially providing materials demanded in the major sectors of the national economy but only a few have national measures taken for their provision.

>Just to tell them to buy and use as much as they can even those goods which don't certainly have to be imported and which are domestically produced, is the most typical expression of dereliction found in the organs for economic guidance characterized by shifting their responsibilities on to the lower units by abusing the slogan ""self-reliance.""

>The construction field also lowered the plan for building dwelling houses in the Pyongyang City than the goal decided by the Party Congress under the excuses of the supply of materials and labor. These are seeds of self-protection and defeatism of officials in the field of economy who are trying to find a breather and make pretense of doing work under the pretext of condition and environment.

>The continuity of such status would result in gradual disappearance of the economic authority and control power of the state and in pushing state-run enterprises to illegal moneymaking.

...

>The General Secretary in the report put important emphasis on waging intensified struggle for putting an end to unit specialization and self-centeredness as the one involving the whole Party, state and society when conducting the first year's work for implementing the decisions of the Party Congress.

>The report said that misuse of power, bureaucratism and irregularities and corruption are anti-Party and anti-people acts committed by individuals, whereas unit specialization and self-centeredness are graver anti-Party, anti-state and anti-people acts perpetrated under the veil of unit and organization, stressing these are the biggest obstacle in applying our Party's people-first politics and consolidating our own strength, our internal driving force.

>It specially evinced that the practices of unit specialization and self-centeredness which infringe on the interests of the state and people and neglect the implementation of the decisions and instructions of the Party must not be allowed to go at large any longer but be stamped out resolutely by mobilizing the Party authority, legal right and military prerogative.

>It expressed the determination of the Party Central Committee to regard unit specialization and self-centeredness as the enemy to the revolution and state tantamount to the misuse of power, bureaucratism and irregularities and corruption and to wage an all-out war against it with the plenary meeting as an occasion, and dealt with the issue for all Party organizations, political and state organs and all the people to be the main force in the war for wiping out unit specialization and self-centeredness.

...

>What should be settled immediately at present is to improve the guidance and management of the Cabinet and state economic guidance organs over the whole economy by restoring the function peculiar to them as economic organizer and their controlling function.

>State economic guidance organs should emerge from old-fashioned force of habit by which they used to put the blame on bad condition, complaining lack of authority, and take a hands-off approach towards the national economy and actively wage a campaign for overcoming economical difficulties and obstacles.

...

>The report called for overcoming obstacles and difficulties by making everything dovetailed from the planning, paying attention to organic contact and cooperation among economic sectors, thoroughly rejecting the evasion of responsibility and self-centeredness existing among state economic guidance organs and actively supporting and supplying each other purposefully, consciously and actively.

>It is important to establish strict discipline in the fulfillment of plans and do thorough-going summing up for the substantial organization and command of economic work.

>It is necessary for the Cabinet and state organs for economic guidance to raise high demand while providing necessary condition for every production unit to unconditionally carry out their plan for production and supply of materials, and conduct an intensive struggle against such phenomena as bargaining, defaulting and observing discipline in the fulfillment of plans for mere form's sake.

>The report also set forth tasks for the Cabinet and state organs for economic guidance to boldly wage the work for improving the economic management method.

>It is necessary to prioritize the state-wide seeking and applying of methods for grasping all products and incoming materials in their numbers in a unified way and circulating them in improving the economic management method.

>It is necessary to properly combine the political method with economic and technological method and administrative and organizational method to settle the economic management our own way in line with our own situation.

...

>The General Secretary in his report set forth the tasks for guaranteeing the fulfillment of the national economic plan by law.

>Saying that nobody has a right to bargain with the national economic plan and they have only a duty to unconditionally carry it out as it is the order of the Party and law of the state, he stressed the need for the law field to set it as the core task to legally, powerfully and closely guarantee the national economic plan for this year and thoroughly carry it out.

...

>The report noted that the serious mistakes made in attaining the goals of the five-year strategy for national economic development set forth at the 7th Party Congress were caused by the misguidance by the Party committees at all levels over the economic work and the failure of the Party officials in fulfilling their responsibility and role as the organizer and standard-bearer in implementing the Party's policies.

**Struggle against anti-socialist and non-socialist practices**

>Stressing that our revolution, which has entered the new development stage, strongly calls for more intensified struggle against the anti-socialist and non-socialist practices than ever before, the General Secretary in his report clarified his revolutionary will and determination to definitely remove vicious cancer that threatens our ideology and social system and hinders single-minded unity.

>Also suggested in his report was the task of powerfully waging the struggle against anti-socialist and non-socialist practices in the Party organizations, working people's organizations, government organs and law enforcement institutions.

>The report noted that powerful combined headquarters should be organized ranging from Pyongyang to provinces, cities and counties so that they could grasp the actual conditions of the struggle against anti-socialist and non-socialist practices in a unified way on one and the same principle and powerfully carry it out in an intensive and diverse way.

>It specially stressed the need for the Party organizations to intensively carry out the operation for overcoming abuse of power, bureaucratic behavior and irregularities and corruption among the officials as well as definitely remove those who connive at and fostering anti-socialist and non-socialist acts from the ranks of officials.

>It is necessary to set it as the most important task for defending the socialist character of our state and for rooting out the anti-socialist and non-socialist practices to urgently solve economic management problem, and solve them one after another in a strict and resolute manner.

>The General Secretary in his report said that all officials should clearly bear in mind that low-keyed struggle done only in words will never end anti-socialist and non-socialist practices and that if so they and our people will be made to pay a dear price. He stressed the need for the officials to fulfill their responsibilities and duties in the struggle for mercilessly curbing and stamping out anti-socialist and non-socialist acts found in their own sectors and units for the destiny of the country, people and younger generation, and consolidating Korean-style socialism.

>Listening to the report of the General Secretary, the participants once again inscribed the necessity and urgency of the intensified struggle against anti-socialist and non-socialist acts and received powerful methodology and solutions to them and hardened their pledge to firmly defend Korean-style socialism and add luster to it.",7981953289443801387,0

This morning (Sept 23) hundreds of West Papuan students who had just returned home from elsewhere in Indonesia because they didn't feel welcome outside Papua, took to the streets to protest a teacher working there who allegedly called Papuans a monkey (similar case to last month). One thing led to another, they were met with police violence and three students were killed at the hands of Indonesian forces.

The police is back to their usual bullshit. They are claiming that the allegations are hoax. And the communication ministry is back to shutting down internet access to silence them and to prevent any information from coming out of West Papua.

510,ldl4gg,My experience with communism,"(also posted on r/socialism)

My name is Victor, I'm 32 years old, I'm Brazilian, english is not my first language so I'm trying my best to write an understandable text. I want to share how I became a Communist. I *always* believed in social justice but liberal propaganda from tv, radio, and so on never allowed me to accept communism (at ~15 years old). Was easier for me to accept the so called ""third way"" (as a center left) bc seemed more rational to take the good side of socialism (a more acceptable name to many of us who came from a traditional family) and the good things from capitalism (after some time we know that this is none). But as I started living I saw that as a way the elites found to give a voice to the worker class so we don't just rebel against them creating a false sensation of freedom. After some time I was able to identify this strategy as a mechanism to keep the worker class under control. I saw that we already have a form of social democracy running in Brazil and other countries (with some more and others less stable economy and society). After all I see that the bourgeoisie are the masters and we are still the same slaves as before. To make it shorter I believe that only revolution can bring us an equal society. And to make that possible we need to keep educating ourselves and those around us to make this revolution possible in the future. 

I'm still learning about Communism and ofc I'll make many mistakes but this is what I am: a Communist, a Marxist!

Now I'm comfortable enough to say to all and to defend what I believe.

**BAYAN CONDEMNS DEADLY CRACKDOWN OF ACTIVISTS IN SOUTHERN LUZON**  
The Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (BAYAN) condemns in the strongest  possible terms the brutal and deadly crackdown on activists in Cavite,  Laguna, Batangas and Rizal early morning today, March 7.

The PNP has confirmed that 9 were arrested, six were killed, and six  others “escaped” in simultaneous raids on offices and homes of the  activists based on 18 search warrants. A number of search warrants used  were issued by Judge Jose Lorenzo de la Rosa of the RTC Manila Branch 4.

Among those killed were Bayan Cavite coordinator Manny Asuncion, who  was gunned down in the raid at the Workers Assistance Center in  Dasmariñas, Cavite, an institution founded and headed by the late Fr.  Joe Dizon.

Among those arrested was BAYAN Laguna spokesperson Mags Camoral, who  was arrested in the raid of the Defend Yulo Farmers campaign  headquarters in Cabuyao, Laguna. Also raided was the house of BAYAN  Batangas coordinator Lino Baez.

These attacks on Bayan leaders, as well as other activists and human  rights defenders in the Southern Luzon region, comes at the heels of  Pres. Rodrigo Duterte’s order to the PNP and AFP to disregard human  rights and kill suspected rebels. It is no coincidence that the AFP  Southern Luzon Command is headed by notorious red tagger Gen. Antonio  Parlade, Jr., who can only be too eager to follow his Commander in  Chief’s order.

We hold Pres. Duterte and Gen. Parlade directly accountable for the  killing and illegal arrest of these unarmed activists, as well as the  brazen weaponization of search warrants and planting of evidence that  were done to justify such actions. This adds to the long long list of  atrocities committed by Duterte and his tyrannical, fascist regime.

We demand that all those arrested be freed and that an independent,  credible investigation into the simultaneous raids be done by Congress  and the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) to hold those responsible to  account.

We likewise demand that that the Supreme Court take immediate steps  to prevent the further weaponization of search warrants and other  judicial instruments to silence activists, political dissenters and  government critics.

We call on our people to be steadfast in these trying times and to  not be intimidated. Let us persevere in the struggle to end the Duterte  fascist regime.#

518,hr4b0v,"I read the first volume of Xi's ""Governance of China""","So recently I read the first book of Xi's Governance of China series, and because I'm primarily on Twitter I did a thread on what I found interesting. Since I went through the trouble of writing that up, I thought I might as well share it here also. Since this is from twitter, I didn't explain everything in detail, but if you want to learn more you should just read the book yourself. Hope you enjoy.

First off, for those that don't know, this book was made with the intent to help the world understand China's policies, and I went into it with that intent in mind. Not to try and glorify or demonize China, but to try and get some insight into their decision making. 

One of the first things I found as a reader was that Xi divides China's history into two phases: before and after the reform and opening up. He makes it clear though that they haven't abandoned Socialism or Marxism, and MZT still plays a decisive role in their politics. 

The CPC, guided by Xi, is deeply committed to serving the people, providing them with a better life, and employing the Mass Line. They also give a tip priority to the planning of the economy (which is explained in greater detail later). 

One of the profound things in the book is exactly how Xi explains what exactly the ""Reform and Opening up"" is. I thought this just meant the market economy, and becoming integrated with the world affairs, and this is partly true, but there is more to it. 

Xi explains that the Reform and Opening up is an ""in depth revolution."" It is their direction to continuously self-improve and develop socialism. It means that China is constantly changing and as it changes they need to constantly reform the system in order to improve. 

""Reform and opening up is an in-depth and all-round social transformation... Reform and opening up is always an ongoing task and will never end."" To me, this seems like a highly dialectical outlook on their affairs. 

Xi affirms that Socialism with Chinese Characteristics IS Socialism, but acknowledges that China as a country is still developing and is only in the primary stage of socialism, or the low stage, and that they will remain so until they are a fully developed economy. 

Xi stresses the importance of democracy being institutionalized and not being changed whenever leadership changes (which to me looks like they are still wary about a potential revisionist like Krushchev). Of Course Xi made it a big focus to root out corruption. 

Xi emphasizes that they are now much stronger than they used to be, but that they are strongly committed to PEACEFUL DEVELOPMENT, and that they have no desire to seek hegemony and bully or assert their views onto weaker nations. 

One of the great things about this book is that it was  published in 2014 with many speeches taking place many years before that. So six years later we can examine whether or not Xi has been able to deliver on his promises, which in many if not all cases appears to be yes. 

Xi talks extensively about the importance of eradicating poverty.   ""It is the essential requirement of socialism to eradicate poverty, improve the people's livelihood and achieve common prosperity.""

""It is a requirement for social fairness and justice as well as an important measure for the people to share the fruits of reform and development.""  Now many years later, we can see that some parts of China are still poor, but they have indeed eliminated extreme poverty. 

Xi emphasizes in greater detail that China is dedicated to peaceful development.  ""The Chinese nation loves peace. To abolish war and achieve peace has been the most pressing and profound aspiration of the Chinese people since the advent of modern times."" 

""With the agonizing sufferings inflicted by war etched in our memory, we Chinese cherish peace and stability. What we abhor is turbulence, what we want is stability and what we hope to see is world peace."" 

In tandem with this, he supports nations rights to self-determination and choosing their own social system and path of development. 

Xi says that cooperation with African nations has always been important to China's foreign policy, and that this will never change. He also says that as China grows stronger, it will continue to provide assistance to Africa WITH NO POLITICAL STRINGS ATTACHED. 

While talking about the silk road, Xi explains that China seeks common development, aiming for a better life for Chinese people AND THE PEOPLE OF OTHER COUNTRIES. 

One of the things I noticed in my own personal study of China's economy was the slowdown of growth from an average increase in GDP from 10% a year to 7% or 6%. Xi explains that this was an intentional move, designed to ensure the long-term development of China. 

As Xi puts it, ""Killing the goose to get the eggs or draining the pond to catch the fish is no formula for sustainable development.""

The last thing I found noteworthy is that Xi stresses the importance of maintaining close ties with the people. He says that this is essential to improving the Party's conduct, and ""Losing contact with the people would pose the gravest threat to the party."" 

This is just my opinion, but I have not found any red flags indicating that they have retreated from Socialism or abandoned Marxism.

China has a hybrid economy that is one part capitalist market, but is at the end of the day, under the control of the communist party, not the other way around. 

China is also committed to peaceful development, and I think, at least in this stage, some comrades are asking too much of them if they think that in order to be truly socialist they must personally intervene wherever there is injustice in the world. Yes, we'd all love that, but this sentiment reeks of idealism. 

I have also ordered Volumes 2 and 3, and I very much look forward to seeing how they have changed.",-8755744905155624396,0

But the mobilization of the state has been proven necessary for the longevity and survival of socialism and communism. Case and point: Venezuela. 

Chavistas have chosen a electoral revolution since the election of Hugo Chavez. [If anyone wants to watch anything that is truly inspirational,  watch the people fight back against powerful elites, in real time, and demand Chavez back in power](https://youtu.be/iH5nzZU0qCc?t=3097). 

With that said, was Chavez going to break up into socialistic communes? Demolish hierarchies? Democratize workplaces with capitalistic elements riddled within? No. He used the state to mobilize the revolution for the people. He provided gigantic reforms for the poor, fought back imperialists, and alleviated the country as a whole. 

Yes, he could have done a hell of a lot more in the private sector and economy. Some may critique that this was the reason for the economic strife, and revolution outside the voting booth is much more effective. 

Yet, Chavez was an important figure in fighting against imperialists, [using Leninist rhetoric to fight back against these elites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt-qTFACJ4Q).

MacArthur, who led the United Nations Command during the conflict, wanted to drop “between 30 and 50 atomic bombs … strung across the neck of Manchuria” that would have “spread behind us … a belt of radioactive cobalt.”

How many Americans are familiar with the statements of Secretary of State Dean Rusk or Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas? Rusk, who was a State Department official in charge of Far Eastern affairs during the Korean War, would later admit that the United States bombed “every brick that was standing on top of another, everything that moved.” American pilots, he noted, “were just bombing the heck out of North Korea.”


This should never be forgotten. In the US, the Korean war is known as ""The forgotten war"". Only a truly evil country could forget atrocities such as these.",1354459711185466041,0

Roughly a week ago, I read [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/9rx3kv/chinas_most_popular_entertainment_channel_hunan/) about Hunan Television's Marxist talk show, ""Socialism is kinda cool"" (社会主义有点潮). I'd been aware of the show for quite a while but hadn't paid it much attention. When I saw the level of interest that /r/communism showed, I figured I would contact the minds behind the programme to let them know.

So, yesterday I met with Zhang Guozuo, the director of the Chinese Cultural Soft Power Research Center and Dean of the School of Marxism at Hunan University, and put two requests to him:

1. Please translate the two seasons of this show into English
2. Please consider a new episode/season about the struggles of Communists outside of China

Professor Zhang told me that he thinks these are both excellent ideas. He will contact the production staff at Hunan Television and encourage them to produce English subtitles. He also said that he is eager to develop a plan for a third season where foreign Communists will be interviewed.

If comrades have any ideas for a possible third season, or wish to recommend possible guests to appear, please comment in this thread. I will share these suggestions with Professor Zhang next time I see him.

&#x200B;

Edit: “Talk shows” not ""talks hows""

Further Edit: I'm pretty new to Reddit but I think one is supposed to say thank you for gold. So, thank you kind stranger! At the moment, English subtitles haven't been confirmed so I don't know where they will be made available. However, I will keep in touch with Professor Zhang and report back when I have something concrete. What I really hoped to do with this post was two fold:

1. Collect good ideas from comrades around the world that I can present to Professor Zhang for a potential third season. The more and better ideas we have for him, the more likely I think he is to act on his word. He is an extremely busy person with a lot of projects on the go, so if we can present something well formed he is much more likely to use it. 
2. Encourage comrades to take chances and reach out to others with ideas, projects or whatever. 

Thank you to everyone below who has contributed suggestions!

I think even for non-marxists, it is very obvious Hollywood is a propaganda machine for the bourgeoisie and imperialists. 

A neutral observer can easily see that movies like Rocky 4, Red Dawn are anti-soviet. The Patriot, Pearl Harbor are revisionist history. Pretty woman, Wolf of Wall Street glorify pursuit of wealth and their lifestyle. American sniper dehumanizes the “enemy” and glorifies the killing of them. The examples are endless. 

I want to know if there are any marxist sources about this subject. How this shapes people’s thoughts and views. 

Also please share your insight and opinions of this as I am looking forward to your discussions.

Edit: I know some commenters are disagreeing with my view on Wolf of Wall Street. I put that there because even though it ends badly but throughout the film it does glorify the lifestyle in my view. It’s fine to disagree with me but my point is that there are many movies that glorify the luxuries and excess of the wealthy.

I have looked through Reddit and a few other sources, but haven't found a group where people would be able to help each other mentally using a lens of dialectical materialism.

Many of us experience burnout and mental fatigue due to our continuous struggle not only with the existing mode of production, but with capitalist propaganda that demonizes many mental health problems and often practices victim blaming instead of helping people to learn.

Some would argue that many mental health issues stem from the existing conditions.

I personally would want to talk to like-minded comrades who are aware of class antagonism and how capitalism shapes our perception of the world.

What do you think? Do you think there is a need for a separate space for us to vent our frustrations and support each other here on Reddit? Or do you know of any already existing spaces like this?

I stopped thinking that bad people exploiting their fellow human through labour and war, but even those better than me as a person would do it simply because the system demanded it. They would gleefully do it, and being praised for it.

The people will be left with a decision to make between whether they should participate or whether they should not in order to avoid ending up on those databases. Employers will avoid employing any individual that has ever participated in strike action. Landlords will avoid housing any individual that has participated in rent strike action. Governments will repress those that participate in any organised action.

532,5zbvcc,Today in 1883 Karl Marx died.,"""On the 14th of March, at a quarter to three in the afternoon, the greatest living thinker ceased to think. He had been left alone for scarcely two minutes, and when we came back we found him in his armchair, peacefully gone to sleep -- but for ever.

An immeasurable loss has been sustained both by the militant proletariat of Europe and America, and by historical science, in the death of this man. The gap that has been left by the departure of this mighty spirit will soon enough make itself felt.

Just as Darwin discovered the law of development or organic nature, so Marx discovered the law of development of human history: the simple fact, hitherto concealed by an overgrowth of ideology, that mankind must first of all eat, drink, have shelter and clothing, before it can pursue politics, science, art, religion, etc.; that therefore the production of the immediate material means, and consequently the degree of economic development attained by a given people or during a given epoch, form the foundation upon which the state institutions, the legal conceptions, art, and even the ideas on religion, of the people concerned have been evolved, and in the light of which they must, therefore, be explained, instead of vice versa, as had hitherto been the case.

But that is not all. Marx also discovered the special law of motion governing the present-day capitalist mode of production, and the bourgeois society that this mode of production has created. The discovery of surplus value suddenly threw light on the problem, in trying to solve which all previous investigations, of both bourgeois economists and socialist critics, had been groping in the dark.

Two such discoveries would be enough for one lifetime. Happy the man to whom it is granted to make even one such discovery. But in every single field which Marx investigated -- and he investigated very many fields, none of them superficially -- in every field, even in that of mathematics, he made independent discoveries.

Such was the man of science. But this was not even half the man. Science was for Marx a historically dynamic, revolutionary force. However great the joy with which he welcomed a new discovery in some theoretical science whose practical application perhaps it was as yet quite impossible to envisage, he experienced quite another kind of joy when the discovery involved immediate revolutionary changes in industry, and in historical development in general. For example, he followed closely the development of the discoveries made in the field of electricity and recently those of Marcel Deprez.

For Marx was before all else a revolutionist. His real mission in life was to contribute, in one way or another, to the overthrow of capitalist society and of the state institutions which it had brought into being, to contribute to the liberation of the modern proletariat, which he was the first to make conscious of its own position and its needs, conscious of the conditions of its emancipation. Fighting was his element. And he fought with a passion, a tenacity and a success such as few could rival. His work on the first Rheinische Zeitung (1842), the Paris Vorwarts (1844), the Deutsche Brusseler Zeitung (1847), the Neue Rheinische Zeitung (1848-49), the New York Tribune (1852-61), and, in addition to these, a host of militant pamphlets, work in organisations in Paris, Brussels and London, and finally, crowning all, the formation of the great International Working Men's Association -- this was indeed an achievement of which its founder might well have been proud even if he had done nothing else.

And, consequently, Marx was the best hated and most calumniated man of his time. Governments, both absolutist and republican, deported him from their territories. Bourgeois, whether conservative or ultra-democratic, vied with one another in heaping slanders upon him. All this he brushed aside as though it were a cobweb, ignoring it, answering only when extreme necessity compelled him. And he died beloved, revered and mourned by millions of revolutionary fellow workers -- from the mines of Siberia to California, in all parts of Europe and America -- and I make bold to say that, though he may have had many opponents, he had hardly one personal enemy.

His name will endure through the ages, and so also will his work.""

534,kdkxqy,Recycling in communism or why CAPITALISM equals GARBAGE,"For those of you who lived in the Eastern block, you probably know about how important was recycling during communism/socialism (whatever you want to call it). For those who don't here we go!

Although the economic system was centralized that centralization was used to actually decentralize production of most goods.

What do I mean by that?

All cities had a special budget for creating new enterprises based on the resources available in the areas and the needs of the local population. What they achieved by that?

* most cities produced most food locally
* a lot of cities produced clothing locally 
* a lot of cities produced furniture locally

Of course the rural area produced more food, while the urban area produced more industrial output (chemicals/electronics/cars/ etc.) , but the cost of transport of goods was greatly reduced since a lot of them were almost self sufficient and most important: THE PACKAGING was minimal.

Using plastic to package food was not practical:

* all bottles were glass bottles
* metal cans were also used for various foods
* meat was packed in paper, you would buy it from the local store
* for vegetables people used reusable bags
* bread came without any packaging, you would buy it from the local stores

All materials were collected by a centralized system - glass/metal/paper.

Also, the citizens received either money for the collected trash or a reduction in price for the goods they bought. You would buy cheaper milk if you brought a milk bottle with you.

The irony is that they didn't do that because they really knew about climate change, but because it was CHEAPER TO RECYCLE. There was plenty of pollution because of the many factories and very few regulations back then (but the west was no better; at that time the climate crisis was not so close).

Needless to say, growing up in the 90's I saw very little trash around the city or in nature.

After the year 2000 it's like a garbage bomb exploded. Of course, after the capitalist counter revolution they shut down all the recycling facilities in the 90's.

After 32 years of capitalism we are going with baby steps towards the waste reduction standards of 1988. But we'll never get there again. Not in my lifetime. 

Waste is part of the capitalist system because packaging materials can be pretty cheap if you exploit workers of poorer countries.

So yeah! Trash is king!

I observed the election process and participated in meetings where Deputies accounted to their constituents. However, most important of all, my family and I experienced the daily life of the Soviet people. For six years we lived at 26 Leningradsky Prospekt, Apt. 12, in the Frunze district of Moscow. We were the ""American family"" in an apartment building housing many Soviet families. For six years we shared the joys of life without landlords, we reveled in heath care without doctors; bills, shopped in our neighborhood stores and at times sweated in the ""ochereds"" (lines). We walked the streets of Moscow and many other Soviet cities day or night without fear. We shared the many still existing scarcities and together with our Moscow neighbors grumbled at the inefficiencies an irritations of petty bureaucracy. In a word, we experienced Soviet life--its strengths and its weakness--to the full. People in the Soviet Union may lack many comforts we still enjoy but I believe the Soviet way of life is more *human.*

536,hyp9sy,"Read theory, understand DiaMat, and I'm no longer a confused socialist/anarkiddie","
Dialectical materialism finally makes sense to me after much engaging with theory and discourse in the past week or so, and (somewhat ironically) through the law of quantity to quality, I have approached an incremental understanding of the philosophy behind Marxism to fully understand the context of the Russian, Chinese, Cuban, Korean, etc, revolutions, and why anarchism has continually failed to bring about significant opposition to imperialism and capitalism. All it takes is reading and rereading, discourse and more discourse, and eventually the qualitative leap of understanding philosophical Marxism will take place, and from it, the other component parts of Marxism.
 

I now finally understand how frustrated my OM, ML, and MLM comrades must have been in the past in trying to educate me when I had no fundamental understanding of the sectarianism I was a part of.

If you're like I was and are struggling to understand these fundamentals behind what we're fighting for, I highly recommend checking out the website ""In Defence of Marxism"" and to listen to lectures from the ""Marx in a Day Event"" from 2018.

Also, for my comrades who are already versed in Marxist theory and more specifically dialectical materialism, I strongly urge you to read ""Reason in Revolt"" which wonderfully outlines how dialectical materialism truly is an immortal science which we base our revolutionary theory, and outlines the existence of dialectics in the numerous fields of science.

The Ultimate goal of T\_D was to support the election candiate Donald Trump as President, to frighten, scare and intimidate the left. Though the sideline rules of the sub reject racism, the proof is in the pudding. Any length of time lurking in that sub and you will discover it's anti-semetic and homophobic underbelly. Sadly, these comments and posts are not removed and the sub itself is riddled with calls for violence against both Jews and Muslims - Further to this it makes use to Anti-semetic memes which are disguised as something else, their use of the NPC meme further adds to the idea that Muslims and Jews and women and gays are not human while encouraging violence against them.   


Their defense of alleged alcoholic rapist Kavanaugh is yet another notch in their belt of venom against the vulnerable, to attack victims of rape, and promote a rapist as some kind of moral paragon and man of the people shines a light on the kind of thinking that is rife in that sub.  


We, as decent humans who stand up for whats right, we on /r/socialism and other subs which defend those who are wrongfully attacked must call on /u/spez to remove this subreddit and ban it entirely. We must put an end to a subreddit which propagates false news, hate, violence against minorities, hate against immigrants, they constantly launch attacks against poor, migrants from central and south america who are simply looking for a better life.

539,b1ujru,Let's ban The_Donald. This is a call to action!!!,"*disclaimer:*

*All of you calling this an attack on free speech, this is an age old fascist tactic ""The Left are the true fascists, they are the thought police and want to take away your rights"" - WRONG, it is you, the Alt-Right, the disguised fascists that are against equal rights, you want freedom for WHITE MEN only because you are Nazi's. Do not buy the bullshit, to anyone who is a centrist understand these are tactics used by the Alt-Right to brainwash the average person and garner sympathy DO NOT BUY IT, stay critical and think for yourself. The Alt-Right always cry about their free speech being infringed upon, they call us totalitarian - the truth is historically, they pretend to value equal rights only when it benefits them, they want rights only for themselves, they say they want to protect free speech but will show no reciprocity once they have gained uninterrupted free speech.*

*I believe it is important to be confronted with views different to your own and to think critically, however, when you abuse the right to free speech, you have pretty much forfeited that right as now you are jeopardising people's rights to safety. T\_D is not simply a place to debate certain topics, they perpetuate a culture that encourages violence - it's not right wing/Trump ideologies themselves but their culture, there is a white supremacist and hateful sentiment, Reddit has become an echo chamber for this hate.  T\_D does not allow for free speech anyway, anyone with a differing opinion is down-voted into oblivion, banned from the sub by mods or receives unfathomable hate and backlash - the users of that sub are unwilling to engage in a constructive discussion.*

The\_Donald has been inciting violence and spreading hate speech for 3 years now, there should be no tolerance of racism, islamophobia, sexism or anything of the like and yet The\_Donald is getting away with it. They are the 3rd most active subreddit and in only three years have managed to gain 700,000+ users. It has become all too easy for them to recruit impressionable/ ignorant minds into their hate movement. Now it is costing lives, with white supremacist attacks such as the recent one in Christchurch, NZ being affiliated with their agenda. Their views are deadly and their platform on Reddit is helping to spread their toxic ideology, more young people will get radicalised and commit atrocious crimes like the Pittsburgh Synagogue shooting, Charlottesville, Colarado Springs - the list is long.

Right-wing terrorism makes up 92% of all ""ideologically motivated homicide incidents"" committed in the United States from 2007 to 2016 according  National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) - it ends now.

Posts with a Islamophobic/racist or hateful sentiment are coming out each day, they are fuelling violence;

Perhaps the most dangerous thing about this subreddit, they are constantly pumping out fake news and statistics:

They are fear-mongering and spreading lies to brainwash their supporters, this is a CULT.

T\_D is cancer and goes against everything we stand for. The users of Reddit have made multiple attempts to get the attention of admins and u/ spez to no avail, we know where their loyalties lie.

We need to bring down this extremist cult, they should not be given a platform to spread their hatred.

**THERE IS STRENGTH IN OUR NUMBERS! ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.**

Here is my proposal;

It is clear the admins are unwilling to do anything so we must take matters into our own hands. We must get this to the attention of big news outlets, Reddit is complicit in the spread of Alt-Right extremism by allowing subs such as T\_D to remain, Reddit is becoming a platform for extremism.

**All I ask is to take 10 minutes out of your day, send an email to the provided addresses, you can use the automated message I have written below or write your own but if enough of us do this we may be successful and expose these subreddits for what they are and also put pressure on the admins if we jeopardise the reputation of this site.**

***Automated message (copy and paste):***

Reddit users are calling for an investigation into Reddit's lack of policy and action against hateful right-wing groups and extremist propaganda.

In recent years, Reddit has become a haven for extremism, Alt-Right extremist groups are becoming increasingly popular and have been allowed to spread hate speech without any intervention. The subreddit [The\_Donald](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald) is the 3rd most active subreddit with more than 700,000 users after only 3 years on the site. They regularly rally hate speech, encourage violence and can be seen celebrating the deaths of Muslims in their recent posts.

The ideology they are spreading is deadly, in the past The\_Donald has [promoted the Charlottesville 'Unite the Right' rally](http://archive.is/3X8PB)  which led to 1 death and dozens of injuries. They radicalised Lane Davis (u/Seattle4Truth)  who murdered his own father. There is an abundance of examples of [blatant racism](https://i.imgur.com/LifF3vy.png). Now they are [condoning the white supremacist terrorist attack](http://archive.is/YZlaz) in Christchurch. It is clear the subreddit is being used to fuel further right-wing extremist attacks ([evidence](https://www.reddit.com/user/areteandstuff/comments/b26v5p/compiled_list_of_t_d_spreading_hate_speech_and/)).

This must end now.

The users of Reddit have started a petition to ban this rhetoric on the site, posts such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/b1adzc/a_desperate_plea_to_the_admins_of_reddit_to_shut/) have gone viral on Reddit gaining more than 24,000 up-votes. However, the admins of Reddit and the CEO, Steve Huffman, are yet to speak or act on the issue.

Is Reddit complicit in the spread of Alt-Right terrorism and hate speech? Are these the ethos of one of the biggest platforms on the internet? And why is Reddit protecting white supremacists?

When right-wing terrorism makes up 92% of all ""ideologically motivated homicide incidents"" committed in the United States from 2007 to 2016, we must ask, could Reddit be playing a part in the radicalisation of people leading them to carry out attacks such as Charlottesville and therefore could it's tolerance for alt-right extremism be responsible for an increase in violent attacks against minority groups?

If anyone wants to improve my message (thank you u/TTheorem for your help editing the message), please do so in the comments. Now let's act, start sending emails!!!

Social media platforms should be held accountable, they're for profit, they too have an agenda and if it allows for the spread of bigotry then they should be exposed. I think if we, the users, raise the stakes for these platforms they will be forced to remove such dangerous rhetoric for fear of being affiliated with it.

Thank you if you choose to partake. Let's put Steve Huffman in the hot seat, we want answers.

EDIT- yes, Vox, the NY times and the Washington Post have previously posted about T\_D, however, there have been no articles written on the topic since 2017, i think it is important for this subject to resurface now especially since Trump is almost at the end of his term and tensions are rising due to alt-right terrorist attacks.

similarly, no one here is against free speech, we are against the spread of an ideology that is taking lives, RIGHT-WING EXTREMISM KILLS.

EDIT 2- wow thank you so much for all your support, i can't believe there are so many of us down for this cause, i'm proud. also thank you for all the silver and gold awards!!! This is the first time i've been gilded <3

\- there's a flood of T\_D hate coming in now, don't engage them, we don't fight hate and ignorance with more hate, just report any hateful comments.

How the hell did he convince so many people he’s the face of ethical, moral, and progressive capitalism? Even Reddit loves him because he’s “meme-y and cool” or some crap. How can we fix this and help people understand he’s the epitome of our late stage capitalism in the modern world?

Update: I really appreciate everyone’s comments, I’ve read them all.

So im stuck at home pretty much throughout the week doing nothing because i never have anybody that i know who is willing to go out or spend any money. I've had enough of being bored inside quite frankly and I want to get out more and meet new people. I live in a small place called Grays in Essex and well there's not a whole lot to do here but there are some decent places to go to.
I find it a bit more difficult to meet new people because ive always had a hard time fitting in with new people... Yeah im socially awkward lol but that hasn't stopped me from meeting new people before and becoming great friends with them.

Stop showing up to police precincts where they are ready and waiting.  Stop letting infiltrators with bullhorns lead you into commercial districts where police will happily start a riot so Fox News can use videos of small businesses being vandalized.

With this said, there will be absolutely ZERO tolerance of anti-semitism here. As Noam Chomsky stated, being anti-Zionist (going against Israeli state policy) is not anti-semitic and we understand the Jewish struggle with past and present discrimination.

553,n9stip,The BBCs coverage of the Israeli land grabs and attacks on prayers at Al Aqsa mosque is nothing short of a white-wash,"Over the past few weeks there have been Israeli government enforced  evictions in Sheikh Jarrah with Palestinians being forced from their  homes to make room for new Israeli settlers. This has already happened,  the evictions are ongoing but they started on the 2nd May.

Keir  Starmer and Nicola Sturgeon have both condemned what's happening, yet  the BBC are still reporting it as ""threatened evictions"" when these  people have already been turfed out of their homes.

There has been footage shared by a number of British MPs of the Israeli  security forces storming a peaceful prayer session at Al Aqsa mosque and  tear-gassing the attendees and this has been described as ""clashes  between forces"". Fully geared IDF troopers vs plain clothes praying  civilians is hardly a both sides affair.

When  comparing it to the coverage of places like China and Syria it becomes  beyond a joke; happy to throw out genocide claims and establish a  narrative in people's minds whenever it's politically convenient -  sending people on whatever goose-chase the neocons in charge have  decided to push to the press that day.

There are current videos circulating of dead bodies (I'll  share in the comments) strewn across the floor from the airstrikes in Gaza and the BBC  report it as a ""clash"" instead of a carpet bombing of civilians.

I just find the hypocrisy of it all completely galling. The same people  who gave us endless performative outrage about Labour's antisemitism,  about Iraq, about Syria are now turning a complete blind eye when it comes to ethnically motivated atrocity that's available for all to see.

Given the BBC are one of the most trusted news sources in the UK, isn't this political slant a big problem?

Counter-attack his nudge theory attempt of normalisation.," This was remove from /r/ukpolitics because they don't like the truth. Posting here where it will hopefully get a more understanding reaction.

&#x200B;

Every time you call Prime Minister Johnson 'Boris' you fall into the media narrative he's attempted to create about himself, this country has a proud tradition of referring to our Prime Minister's by their surnames in context. The reason for this is obvious.

&#x200B;

We referred to Theresa May as May, we referred to David Cameron as Cameron, we referred to Gordon Brown as Brown, we referred to Tony Blair as Blair (although he attempted to pull a similar 'likeable Tony' stunt to the one that Boris is pulling.) We referred to Major as Major, Thatcher as Thatcher, Wilson as Wilson and Heath as Heath and so it goes on.

&#x200B;

The decision by Prime Minister Johnson to go by the moniker of 'Boris' and the press who are favourably to him is to try and get away from the formality of the roles he offers - as reminding us of the formality and importance of those roles quickly shows us how he is completely and utterly unsuited for the high office he currently occupies.

&#x200B;

That's not to mention that 'Boris' is not even Prime Minister Johnson's first name, it's Alexander. Boris is a public persona designed to appear more affable and likeable to the general population as a mask for his true colours, a detestable oligarch stripping the nation on behalf of Russia.

&#x200B;

I asked everyone on reddit who respects the office of Prime Minister, to refer to our Prime Minister as Prime Minister Johnson going forward. Do not let referring to a Prime Minister by their first name become normalised as Prime Minister Johnson wants it to be.

&#x200B;

When you speak to people in person refer to the Prime Minister as Prime Minister Johnson it's only be rubbing it in people's faces that 'Boris' - the dancing buffoon - is holding such high office that we can truly get people to realise that the country needs a change and to get him out.

580,q6hytd,Had enough - cancelled my direct debit,"So that's it folks, I'm out.

Starmer is a joke. I've made my excuses and defended the man in the past, and when he ran for leadership and in the early part of his leadership I thought he'd be pretty damn good. Someone who can put 2017 Labour policies over in a way that won't scare the residents of Twekesbury or Ipswich, whilst simultaneously pleasing the residents of Liverpool and increasing Labour incursions into Portsmouth and Plymouth.

I'm not prepared to pay money to a party which wants to throw it all away on legal cases. I have my own expenses. My mrs is on just above the minimum wage in the care sector. I'm not prepared to fund spurious legal crap when she's on such a shit wage. I work on the railways and she is in social care. I don't believe Labour gives a flying crap about people like us when all it can do is rant on about ""agile methodolgies"" or getting mangement consultants and the likes of PWC in. How many of these people have worked nights wiping people's arses whilst due to mental health issues they try to attack them, or long shifts manually coupling up locomotives in a yard in January in the pissing rain?

We have had a global pandemic which is still going on. Colleagues of mine died. Others have long term health issues now. The railway medicals are fairly stringent so these people weren't frail and at deaths door in the first place. Labour appears not to give a flying fuck. Instead it's the same old ""get back to it, mass crowd, it's all safe"". And now the news is saying what we've all said - one of the UK's greatest ever health failures. I spoke to a guard this week who is in his 30s who was training for the London Marathon before he caught it. I think he's seeing specialists for lung issues now, and certainly cannot run any huge distance. His high level of fitness has certainly protected him to some degree but he's not the man he was. Other older lads are still in a terrible state.

And yet where we do need professional academic types, why aren't we getting advice from anti austerity economists such as Mark Blyth? That man can put complex topics over in a way that an idiot like I can understand. That is supposed to be the job of the Labour leader - argue the case to convince the public - not capitulate to what the establishment says.

If they want to go ""Blairite"", why is Alistair Campbell not sorting their media message out? Why do we have such awful figures like Mandelson being the fucking spokesman? What next? Byers? Hoon?

I'm sick of the double standards - e.g. we must have zero tolerence on anything which remotely could be anti-semitic when it's lefties (fair enough by the way), but strangely tolerated when it's establishment figures or the Labour right. Or indeed failure to deal with transphobia, union bashing and other discrimination.

I'm sick of the fact that Starmer has an opinion on essentially trivial crap - James Bond (who the fuck cares, just give me the Alan Partridge Welsh version actually - Jones the Bond) or getting into some silly trap over a bloody farm animal, whilst refusing to condemn the genocidal child chopping Saudi ruling vermin, and twisting into pathetic contortions over nationalisation of essential monopoly infrastructure which is failing.

I'm sick of the fact that now the party has effectively sidelined the left, they are going for the soft left. Who in their right mind would attempt to oust Rayner, Dodds, Miliband or Nandy if they are for unity? It's not about unity or the pledges or anything else. It's just increasingly ""purge everyone who doesn't agree with global finance capitalism as it currently stands and upholding vested interests"".

There is more I could go on about, but I can't be bothered. Starmer's job was to hold onto the base, attract people from the Greens, attract floating voters and get back former UKIP voters who went Tory. He has basically done none of this. It's a failure.

I'm done. Both myself and the mrs are in unions where we get a say on who leads Labour - so when eventually Mandelson and the westminster based media tire of Starmer enough to attempt to shove their preferred candidate in, at least we can vote against it. Enough is enough.",8795340433800,0

I can't be the only person who came to this sub looking for people who support the labour party. With a hope of doing my part in helping ensure we can oust the conservatives next general election.

The Tories have been running our country into the ground for over a decade and the last couple of years have really taken the biscuit.

We literally face existential threats to our country and the world. Crippling inflation, an ensuing recession that could bring our economy to its knees, growing carbon emissions, massive inequality, a collapsing NHS, gross levels of corruption in government, the stripping away of basic rights to protest, geopolitical instability, selling off our public services to the highest bidder. I could go on all day. 

I want the Tories out. And I want Labour in. 

And I think it's completely do able. The opinion polls have shifted so dramatically in favour of a left wing approach. British people aren't stupid and they know when they're being taken for saps and they clearly want something different to Boris Johnsons corrupt cabinet.

Then I come to r/labourUK. Proudly touting whatever the Tory PR machine spits out. Hurling false scandal after scandal at their own party. You have to tread on egg shells with every comment as just saying 'i think kier Starmer is actually alright' - will incur the wrath of a million downvotes.

Well I think Kier Starmer. And the labour party. Are better on the environment. On the economy. On immigration. On public services. On foreign policy. On education. On any aspect of British life and governance. 

And I'd like to see labour win. 

But people on this sub Reddit seem hell bent on spinning in circles. Making claims that they know full well are not remotely palatable to the electorate. Disingenuously attacking every word a labour MP says, pulling quotes out of context. Sometimes fabricating them altogether.

If you want to indulge some pseudo revolutionary fantasy outside of the democratic process I'm sure there are plenty of subreddits for you. 

Democracy means you have to listen to the populous, communicate better with them, and push for good policy. As labour are now doing.

If anyone on here agrees I'd love to hear. Maybe we can even discuss ways we can organise to help.

Edit: I just wanted to say thank you for all the well reasoned and respectful responses. From people who largely support my opinion. But also from all those who have disagreed in good faith.

I want teachers, nurses etc to be paid the wages they deserve, for a 4 day work week, for the housing crisis to be dealt with, for greed and inequality in our society to be dealt with once and for all, for a climate policy that can put us on the front foot dealing with global warming. 

I’m twenty eight and I’ve been a Labour supporter and voter (when not voting tactically) all my life and I always will be, raised in a socialist household etc. I hate the Tory ideology, the damage and division they’ve caused this country. But for fuck’s sake look at yourselves. Every day I come on here looking for discussion and all I see is anti-Starmer sentiment with almost anybody trying to speak otherwise getting downvoted. 

Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not ‘Starmer till I die’ or a centrist/centre right AT ALL. He’s a very imperfect politician. I don’t necessarily trust him, then again I could say the same about all of them (yes, even Corbyn). Like everybody else I couldn’t really tell you a single solid policy he has going forward into the next election. But the last 12 years of Tory rule have been beyond catastrophic for us. The NHS is down on its knees. Austerity.  Brexit. Over 200K dead from Covid. Corporations and private companies seeing massive increases in profit while unions and ordinary people are being shat on. The tories are turning into the republicans with even abortion laws and human rights on the table ffs.

I don’t mean to undermine your concerns because I get it, he hasn’t been receptive to the left side of the party and what will stick of his pledges remains to be seen (a lot can happen in the next 12 months). Starmer might end up being 5-10% of what we want, but isn’t that better than Truss? Than Sunak or god forbid Boris if he gets his way and somehow wriggles back into number 10? Let alone the rest of the potential ‘leaders’. And in a recent poll wasn’t he 10+ points ahead? We’ve just had one of our worst losses ever for goodness sake and here we are ahead in the polls ready to tear ourselves apart again. 

Our voting system is archaic and broken but if we don’t put ideological purity aside and band together we will be out of power for another 12 years or more, and what the Tories will do to the country in that time I know will be 1000x worse than any centre right leaning labour leader.

Corbyn's old tweet, where he was quoting Desmond Tutu.

https://www.stopwar.org.uk/article/list-of-signatories-stop-the-war-statement-on-the-crisis-over-ukraine/

And Stop the War's recent statement.

I just want to point out that Stop the War aren't just being naive or pacifist here. If you read their articles on this conflict and if you read between the lines on their 'neutral' statement they really have some vendetta against the government of Ukraine.

- You can see in the above article where they call Ukraine's democratically elected government a 'regime' and act like they are equivalent to Putin's regime in Russia. They are clearly trying to be 'neutral' in a situation where the oppressor(Russia) and the oppressed(Ukraine) are clear.

- They actually had this old article in 2014 saying *'In game of Great Power politics, if we have to pick a side over Crimea, let it be Russia'* https://www.stopwar.org.uk/article/if-we-have-to-pick-a-side-over-crimea-let-it-be-russia/

- In their articles I've seen they keep talking disproportionately about the 2014 'US backed coup' in Ukraine that replaced Viktor Yanukovich's pro-Russia government or about the neo-Nazis in Ukraine's Azov battalion but they never talk about Russian domestic politics, how Putin's regime works and the influence of fascist / imperialist ideologies in Putin's Russia and the Russian military.

- Finally I want to share this very disturbing tweet posted last week by one of the main national officers of Stop the War, Fiona Edwards.

https://twitter.com/Fio_edwards/status/1497541944255393793

>The Western media disguises the fact that there has been a military conflict in Ukraine for 8 years.

>**It started with a US-backed coup in 2014 which, with the help of neo-Nazis, removed Ukraine's democratically elected government and replaced it with a pro-NATO regime.** 1/2

>Since the 2014 US-backed coup there has been a low intensity military conflict - **with the Ukrainian military and fascist forces attacking (with weapons supplied by West) the Russian speaking population of Eastern Ukraine - brutal attacks which have killed 14,000 people.** 2/2

She claims Ukraine's government is not democratically elected(Zelensky was elected in 2019) but a 'regime' installed by the USA with the help of neo-Nazis. She also claims that this war happened because of 'Ukrainian military and fascist forces' attacking innocent Russian speaking people in Eastern Ukraine! She also claims Ukraine killed 14,000 Russian speakers when that is just the total death toll of the civil war in Donbas since 2014.

Stop the War aren't just naive. They are *deliberately* spreading Russian propaganda bullshit to demonize Ukraine. These people really hate Ukraine and want to give Russia justification to invade it. This is why Labour MPs and members should NOT associate with this organisation: You can see from their vile language towards Ukraine that they are not pacifist, they're just pro-Russia.

I also appeal for Jeremy Corbyn, who is deputy leader of Stop the War, to either quit this organisation or at least to call for the removal of its national officer Fiona Edwards, who has a malicious anti-Ukraine and pro-Russia agenda that is clear here.",5496494856564884785,0

But now it is clear that Starmer is totally and utterly finished no matter what happens.

1. In the eyes of the public the man is a loser anyway with the result. It would be incredibly hard for him to turn that around, but initially not impossible. It is now
2. His initial response of silence then wittering about change like a third rate Alan Partridge was simply embarassing. Johnson is a fool, but we can remember his policies - no matter how bullshit they are when broken down - Get Brexit Done, 50,000 more nurses, 40 new hospitals and so on. Nothing like that from Starmer, and the only discussion of policy has been a load of Mandelson crap about ""get rid of the 10 pledges"". Whoever thinks everyone will come flocking back to Labour if they promise privatised railways, more zero hour contracts and scrapping the Green New Deal really has their head up their arse.
3. The blame Corbyn strategy was stupid. Corbyn isn't even a Labour MP anymore. Even the failed Hartlepool candidate stated that Corbyn wasn't even mentioned by voters.
4. There appears to be no interest in learning from the winners in this election - whether that is taking notice of Andy Burnham, Welsh Labour, Salford, Preston - or even the somewhat bizarre but welcome local results such as Labour winnig a majority in Folkestone town council. There is also no interest in learning what Johnsonism actually is, nor why the Green vote went up (including in working class areas). Getting someone like Yvette Cooper in - as we keep hearing calls for is a hilariously bad response. Johnson supporters will see her as humourless HR drone, an already pissed off base will simply fail to turn out for her, and Green voters will just think ""Atos? Privatisation? nah go fuck yourself"". Or indeed Jess Phillips, someone who folded like wet cardboard in the first minute at what should be a very simple good natured leadership debate.
5. The sacking of Rayner has gone down about as well as calling for Ghislaine Maxwell to be freed or for Prince Andrew to be crowned King. Everyone from McDonnell to Pro-Starmer journalists to assorted (currently anonymous) front benchers to Andy Burnham have utterly condemned this. It is utterly baffling at best and just plain disgusting at worst. Starmer has now permanently alienated the left, the soft left, his most high profile winner and even plenty who were on his side. It reaks of a man having a meltdown with absolutely no clue what he is doing. Given Rayner cannot even be sacked as Deputy leader, it now means that there is absolutely no way the party can win an election when the two highest positions in the party are now enemies. I wouldn't be shocked if this led to plenty of shadow cabinet resignations and even a credible leadership challenge.
6. The rumours of Nandy and similar being demoted / booted out if true are even more deluded, and will hasten any resignations and leadership challenges. I could see Lisa Nandy in particular causing real trouble for Starmer - but I can also see her having enough backing to oust him, there will be enough from the soft left, left and even neutrals pissed off at this who would likely put any differences aside to get behind someone like her. At best Starmer will simply be continually undermined now by pretty much everyone other than a small band of loyalists - and it won't simply be briefing against him in the shadows - it will be public. You have pissed off Andy Burnham big time - a figure who could actually be the ""unity"" candidate that Starmer claimed to be,
7. There is absolutely no evidence that Mandelson and friends have any winning strategy, nor any appeal outside certain parts of the Westminster / media bubble. If the plan really is to fight an election on the sort of unpopular ""liberal establisment"" policies which no one ordinary really supports (backing the Saudi war in Yemen, privatised water, cutting the troops, TTIP style deals, Chinese investment in nuclear power, foreign ownership of strategic business, assets and public services, supporting bankers or whatever) it is utterly thick. With the left shut out, the soft left shut out and Labour's winners shut out - this appears to be the only direction the party can go in. And it will utterly fail. There is absolutely nothing there to appeal to anyone.
8. Blaming the virus for not getting the message across is simply pathetic. I have had to work through this bloody thing (railways) and lost colleagues to it. So has my mrs (care home worker). Grow the fuck up. We had no choice but to do our jobs and were at far more risk of illness and death than you were Keir. Your mrs works in the health service? Could she simply walk away? No. And it hasn't stopped Johnson, Sturgeon, Burnham or Drakeford from getting the message out has it. If anything people have more time at home to watch the news or read things - be it on social media or the papers. Pathetic. Utterly pathetic.

Starmer must go. He has gone from ""forensic and competent"" to a weird mixture of Alan Patridge and David Brent - but without the gags. And in fact his behaviour post election makes him resemble someone he really doesn't want to be compared to - Chris Grayling who simply resembled a trapped wasp flailing upside down in a toilet for his entire ministerial career.

630,exrcpm,Labour fears the media: a personal account,"As my flair indicates, over the last few years I’ve become sort of a crap party insider. There are a few reasons for this - I’m in a central London CLP, I was a councillor for a couple of years, and I’ve done a lot of hard yards volunteering for the party. These have all given me a bit of ‘face time’ with people more significant than me, and those people ask me to help them with things sometimes.

In addition, I have a very particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a very long career. I run a successful PR agency, and I know how the media works.

So when my CLP’s candidate for the December ‘19 election was dropped on us at the last minute, I offered to help out with raising his media profile. Both the Tory and Lib Dem candidates for the constituency already had much greater name recognition, and we were operating on a very short timeframe.

I sat down with our candidate with four weeks to go, and laid out what I thought he should do - get in front of the Guardian , Evening Standard, Daily Mirror, FT, and a few others to speak to journalists who were obviously going to be writing pieces about our constituency over the coming weeks. He understood and agreed.

There and then, I picked up the phone to half a dozen journalists and arranged to for him to meet them. I then worked with our candidate to put together a ‘key messages’ document, which dealt with both positive and negative issues: on the positive side, the policies that Labour were putting forward that would resonate particularly well in our constituency, and on the negative side, answers for the problem questions he was obviously going to get. I also booked a week off work to handle all of this for free. My clients would generally get changed somewhere in region of £300/hr for this at my commercial rates.

On the negative side, our candidate had one particular issue that needed to be dealt with: antisemitism. Our candidate is Jewish, but for a year until Summer 2019 he was the party’s head of legal & governance. He was brought in by Jennie Formby to completely rebuild our governance framework, including our disciplinary processes. He was picked for the role because he was (a) and extremely accomplished barrister and (b) trusted by the leadership - he has known John McDonnell in particular for decades, and has always been part of the ‘hard left’.

It was (b) that formed the main problem. Since he was close to the leadership, he was seen as being ‘their man’, brought in to make sure they didn’t catch any blame for antisemitism. That wasn’t the case at all - he was brought it because he was excellent at the job. The way the party has sped up getting rid of problem people since the summer (Chris Williamson for example) is down to the system he put in place. But because he has pre-existing relationships with the leadership, he was always going to be tarred with the same brush.

But we war-gamed some excellent answers to deal with the issue, so we knew we would be fine. Then disaster struck.

“You know, I should probably check this with LOTO comms,”, he says.

“Please don’t,” I respond. “Much easier to beg for forgiveness than ask for permission on this.”

But he felt he had to. The answer came back: no media. None.

We were banned from dealing with anything other than local press. But this is central London - the Evening Standard *is* our local press.

Nope. No dice, says Southside. 

I raise a stink. The kid at London regional deputised to deal with me has to hand me off to LOTO comms as he is struggling. No hard feelings towards the guy, but he’s 12 months out of university and I’ve been doing this for fifteen years. He’s out of his depth.

The truth comes out when I finally get LOTO comms to explain the problem - they can’t control what the journalists are going to write about antisemitism, so they have withdrawn entirely. If there is any risk that any individual is going to be asked about antisemitism, then media is off-limits.

When people talk about a bunker mentality, this is what they mean. They had no confidence in their ability to deal with the issue, so they went 100% into the bunker. No amount of persuasion would work. The media is bad so we don’t deal with it.

I looked up the people I was dealing with on LinkedIn. Only one of them was what I would term an ‘accomplished’ PR person. The others were think-tankers, fresh PPE grads, or relatives of senior Labour people. There was an almost complete absence of skill and experience in dealing with the media. They had been recruited based on all the wrong criteria. Now they were in a real battle for the first time, and had no idea what to do.

The whole sorry episode ends with Jennie Formby having to step into the email chain to shut the debate down. It is decreed that no media will happen. Our candidate cannot cross Jennie so it’s over. No media happens. 

All of the newspapers mentioned above, plus several more, do in-depth features on the constituency, including long and detailed interviews with the Tory and Lib Dem candidates. Our candidate is not included.

We come third in the constituency, with 3,000 fewer votes than in 2017.

While using the media to raise our candidate’s profile wasn’t going to be the silver bullet that won it for us, I’m still angry that we went down meekly surrendering instead of fighting.

The whole thing reinforces the belief I have had since 2015: my problem with having a hard left leadership of the party is almost nothing to do with policy. It’s to do with managerial competence. By the time the 2019 election came around, there was very little skill or experience left in the party’s executive branch, as anyone not trusted by the leadership was gradually sidelined or removed in favour of loyalists with little ability.

A free press is vital to maintaining a healthy democracy, and media oligarchs stand directly in opposition to a free press - they are mafioso media, running nothing but propaganda for the purpose of misleading and manipulating the people. Something must be done about it. Labour must set out a plan to democratise the press in our next manifesto. A capitalist press is not a free press, and never will be.

>Keir Starmer refuses to deny that the Labour Party is in talks with Conservative MPs who are considering defecting

A new party of One Nation Tories are born, I guess.

I don't think I've ever seen a more disingenuous Labour leader in my lifetime. From the pledges, to this, is Keir Starmer just a hollow suit piloted by others?

His pledges were clearly based on the 2019 manifesto under an assumption that if you don't like Corbyn, now that he's gone, Labour values will at least carry on by... the Labour party.

I guess everything hinges on Ed Davey forcing PR so the UK Labour party can split. Good luck with that, Lib Dem HQ already briefing this week ""We'll work with Tories if they aren't led by Boris Johnson"" to test the waters.

How do they expect us to keep supporting them?

Labour members and supporters are the literal core support and voting base of the Labour Party - the people out canvassing, knocking on doors at elections, reaching out to people, donating their money etc.

For their Shadow Chancellor to call us a bunch of racists after all the time and energy we spent trying to support and get Labour elected feels like a kick in the teeth.

A couple of years back it turns out that he’s been in the UK illegally, after overstaying his visa after coming here from Barbados in the early 90’s. He’s always worked, never claimed a single benefit and has always paid his way as best he can. A few months ago one of Patel’s minions found him and served papers on him. He’s being deported. So he’s been getting his stuff back together. He has three bicycles that he wanted to take back to Barbados with his.  So we found boxes, stripped them down, packed them up and secured them so he could transport them home. 

He took them away two nights ago in a hired van, and stopped outside his old flat in Dalston to pick up some more bits. Three guys surrounded him, took his bikes out of his van, threw them in their own van and drove off.

Sunak's wife, Akshata Murty, is the daughter of a Billionaire. She owns shares worth £430M in her father's company alone, meaning she has more money than the Queen.

Sunak himself, is a former hedge fund manager and Goldmann Sachs banker who attended the elite boarding school of Winchester College. 

Today it costs £41,709 to send a child there for one year 😳 

Sunak's property holdings span several continents, and just one of his homes in London alone is worth £7M.

This is the man holding down the minimum wage and refusing to properly pay our key workers.

The people making these decisions don't have the faintest idea what life is like without the saftey blanket of financial security.

Me: ""Well my views are fundamentally opposed to yours, so I don't think we should get into this now [in the middle of the meeting]"".

Because we Tory boys can discuss our politics during a meeting to our heart's content. But lord forbid should a lefty woman dare mutter her conflicting opinion.

*Edit*

Cor, this garnered a bit more engagement than I expected! 
Thanks all for your comments, especially the solidarity, I needed that today!

So to give some more detail/context:

The comment was made by the younger of the two colleagues, with whom I generally have a pretty good working relationship. It was definitely intended in jest. However...It's the undertone and basis for the humour which riled me. I do believe his comment was intended to ingratiate himself with the older male colleague. He may not have consciously intended it to be at my expense, but as he'd begun the meeting by attempting to assert himself by treating me as his secretary (I was only there because he needed my help), I couldn't help but find some misogynistic undertones in my expressing dissent immediately translating as 'kicking off'.

The older colleague, following this, queried my voting preferences. I have recently decided that I will not hide my views at work for ease, because then the narrative never changes. So I told him I'd rather have any labour govt over any Tory one. His response was gold. Clearly I'm 'not old enough to have lived under a labour government and don't remember all the blackouts last time they were in power and you had to eat your biscuits in the dark'.
