The center-right 'Venstre' party (which was previously the party in government), went from 43 seats to 23 seats. New parties that split off from older parts entered the Parlament: Danish Democrats (split from the Danish People's Party) and the Moderates (split from Venstre).

But the big win is arguably for the Liberal Alliance party, a libertarian party. They went from 4 seats in the previous election to 14 seats. This is interesting, since last year in Argentina, 4 libertarian politicians were elected into their Parliament, and according to some sources, the Libertarians are now polling around 30%.

136,yfw4l5,How the federal government caused minorities in the U.S. to struggle,"As someone who is quite inquisitive in the sense where I like to learn more about different things, I wanted to learn more about why things are the way they are. Why are life circumstances the way they are for everyone right now? And after research, and time to think, I've came to the conclusion that everything we see around us, it's all by design. Have you ever wondered why drugs in the U.S. are a problem when several decades ago it wasn't?

I believe the federal governments destruction of minority communities started in the late 70s. Jimmy Carter was a radical liberal for his time. And he proposed Welfare bills and Food stamp bills for various amounts of people. For people unemployed, single parents trying to raise kids, and people just struggling. This on paper sounds fine, and granted, some people do take advantage of it, but at the time of it's inception, it was fine. But later on events only made things worse.

In the 80s, when the U.S. was trying to stop Communism from expanding, the C.I.A. was of course aiding anti-communist factions in various countries. In order to help this one gang gather enough money for weapons and supplies, the C.I.A. (under Regan) started selling crack and other drugs into American cities and towns with the gangs so they could raise money. That was a horrible mistake. The U.S. is still suffering today, and even our neighbors down south, thanks to that. The drugs ended up targeting minority communities too. And then to make things worse, Regan created the [Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1986) as a part of the War on Drugs to make the Government seem innocent when they designed the issue themselves. Then, there was the icing on the cake.

In the 90s, then Senator Joe Biden, along with President Bill Clinton started passing out excessive and ruthless crime bills targeting minorities in their respective locations, the laws went after the most stupid things too such as Marijuana, non-violent gun offenses, and so on. Many were arrested because of this. And this is when society really focused on the concept of police brutality and the police having too much power. This is when a cycle was created. People are suffering from illegal drug abuse. People get sent to brutal prisons due to that, and are took away from their families, kids, spouses.

Single mothers raising kids get put on welfare and food stamps and no longer have to work. Then kids growing up in poverty, around drugs, and with their fathers taken away and traumatized by it and then they are more likely to grow up and ""commit crime"", it's an endless cycle, rinse and repeat. Now, with all that being said, did Carter, Regan, the C.I.A., Clinton and Biden all tend for things to be this way? Did they all want minorities to struggle? I'm honestly not too sure. The main reason is because all of these bills and operations happened decades apart. But regardless, now they have all came together and caused a big problem, and left wing or right wing, it's all thanks to the federal government.

So, what can we do about this? Well, we need to ease drug and gun laws, release those for drug crimes and those who committed non-violent gun offenses. Make drugs legal, and then those making money from them illegally won't make as much if drugs are easier to obtain and legal tender.

I already (self) studied the works of Schumpeter and Böhm-Bawerk.

To keep it short - I search a good book/paper which is:

* Not older than 15 years (recent developments within ASOE should be included)
* Introduction to all relevant concepts / show the differences to mainstream economics
* Not relying on praxeology (I tried reading Mises Human Action, but was not impressed)

**\*edit:** \- I found two interesting books and one research paper:

* *Holcombe, Randall G. (2020): Advanced Introduction to the Austrian School of Economics, Edward Elgar*
* *Mayer, Thomas (2017): Austrian Economics, Money and Finance, Routledge*

If you take a large sample of houses with cats, and just opened the door and let the cats leave, some would. Some would die, some would struggle, some would thrive. Some would come back, some would go be happy to never see you again.

But you won't *LET* them leave. You are afraid that after everything you've done for the cat, the cat would just fuck off and leave. You are afraid that the dependency you projected onto the cat isn't real. That the cat does not need you, as much as you need it. You need to feel like a good person by ""taking care of"" the cat. But you never stopped to think if the cat wants or needs you to take care of it, or if it's just stuck in the system you locked it into.

And ultimately, you're afraid to find out what it would do with freedom, because you're afraid it doesn't need you. And you need, to be needed. You need to be in control over the cat, and you're terrified of losing that control. So you pretend the cat needs you, without ever giving it a choice to show that it doesn't.",4658710741871502363,1

203,ynnh4t,"In this climate of debating immigration, can we talk about children?","Let's start with some basic conservative assumptions that we rely on the growth and productivity of the workforce in order to fund our current spending/ aging population, and that the gap left by the native work force is filled by immigration so neither party wants to curtail this. Ok? Got it?

I want to move this conversation forward to talk about what I contentious issue which is the birth rate of settled, British born, middle class in this country. Why are we not having enough kids to maintain our replacement level?

Without going all nutcase replacement theory, there are certain groups that will have multiple children; but the more educated, career focused and wealthier households are the less children we will have. And that needs to change if we actually want to get a hold on immigration.


As a young woman, Tory, but also ambitious individual, I don't think we should blame educated women as the demons here- I would love to have multiple children, but I've narrowed it down to three factors that make it less desirable for me, university educated, has a decent job and stable relationship to consider having more than 2 children, compared to a immigrant or working class population where the mother (or both parties) doesn't work. (I'm an immigrant myself but a very middle class one with two highly skilled professional parents) 


1/ The obvious: prohibitive cost of childcare vs career progression: women who don't want to take a massive career break at a time in their lives where big promotions and officerships takes place. Having multiple children in succession would be career suicide, but if you're on the cusp of the free childcare bracket then all your allowance gets taken away and you get burnt both ends. People on lower salaries or in communities where women are expected to stop working after children don't experience this squeeze as much as they break even if they don't work vs. sacrificing a much higher salary.


2/Average quality of schooling in this country is awful, so either you have to plan and see how many children you can afford to privately educate, or the cost of buying a family home in a decent grammar/comprehensive catchment area. My education as an only child in a relatively LCOL city in this country cost my parents £100,000+ over my adolescence. London schools are more expensive, London postcodes even more so. Very little is being done to improve the quality of primary and secondary education in this country and instead we are seeing lots of academy/ faith school/ schools where there's basically only single demographic pupils due to the socio economics of the area. 


3/ House prices factor in/almost necessitate having double income households... So say you've done all the right things to counteract the above, paid for your 'good comprehensive school catchment' postcode, found a place with decent nurseries nearby, overmortgaged yourself with your partner, salary sacrificed to keep your childcare allowance... Will you ever be able to take time off to spend with your babies in their earliest years? If you have a slightly more complicated pregnancy, a child with special needs etc. There's a choice that will have to be made about returning to the workforce or a parent taking a pay cut. 



One of my ideas to solve to this would be cut child benefits to remove the incentive to 'just have children' and replace it with free childcare for all. This encourages more people who participate in the workforce to have children without sacrificing work. I've been informed by my boyfriend that this would be an instant vote loser on par with Liz Truss, but I'm trying to think long-term here.

242,yjmx84,Have the tories deliberately underfunded the NHS,"I work in the NHS.

I hear a lot of talk from my colleagues as well as the public as to how the Tories have deliberately underfunded the NHS in order to expand privatisation and eventually get rid of healthcare that is free at the point of delivery.

Wait times in the NHS from primary care to secondary cafe are currently abysmal for anything that is not a 2 week wait. I myself have experienced ordering urgent scans for patients to be done within the next 4 weeks only to be told that the wait is 3 months minimum (this was last year). Now I’m told by colleague such a scan would take a year. Patients are waiting hours (10+) to be seen in A&E. 2 ww targets for cancer are being missed.

I wasn’t working in the noughties but I am told that the NHS ran much better then, staff were well paid with higher morale and so retention was better, wait times were lower etc but since austerity everything has gone down hill.

Now I have never voted conservative, and I am not a labour voter either. I am not a die hard NHS fan but neither am I completely against it. I just want a health service that works.

I am aware there are some in Tory circles who would like to be rid of the NHS. But I struggle to believe that the current state of the NHS is due to deliberate underfunding because why would anyone do that surely? I know COVID has exacerbated things but things weren’t that great in 2019 either. 

Would we be in a similar state now had Labour been in charge during the 2010s or has all of this been a part of the big bad Tories?

EDIT:

My gut suspicion is that this situation is due to poor retention of staff, necessary austerity given the public finances in 2010 were honestly terrible (as opposed to cutting services for the hell of it) and the realities of an ageing population. And the fact that the NHS may not have the best funding model for our current populations needs.",-4635687493878771918,1

**This was supposed to be the week we got the government’s fiscal plan.**

But with the arrival of a new prime minister, Jeremy Hunt’s financial package has been delayed until 17 November. Expect big cuts and tax rises. The figure being talked about is £50 billion.

**Instead, there’s plenty of lawmaking to be done.**

One government bill making its Commons debut would create a publicly-owned infrastructure bank to invest in projects that tackle the climate emergency or address regional inequality.

**And reshuffles have created a number of select committee chair vacancies.**

Health, Treasury, Education, and Transport are all up for grabs. Select committee chair positions are divided between the parties, and all four of these have to be Tories.

So far, Steve Brine and Anne Marie Morris have been nominated for health, and John Baron and Harriett Baldwin for Treasury.

### MONDAY 31 OCTOBER

**Genetic Technology (Precision Breeding) Bill - report stage and 3rd reading**  
Allows the sale of gene-edited food. Potential mooted uses are to crops more drought-resilient or resistant to diseases. Gene editing differs from genetically modifying in that it's a small, controlled tweak to a living organism’s existing DNA rather than the introduction of a new, foreign gene. Both are de-facto banned in the EU so this is a major post-Brexit divergence from EU law.

**Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill - consideration of Lords amendments**  
Introduces regulation to make smart devices (like smart TVs and speakers) more secure against cyber attacks. Aims to speed up the rollout of mobile, full-fibre and gigabit-capable networks across the UK.

### TUESDAY 1 NOVEMBER

**Internet Access (Children Eligible for Free School Meals) Bill**  
Requires the government to ensure that all children eligible for free school meals have a broadband connection and facilities to access the internet at home. Ten minute rule motion presented by Siobhain McDonagh.

**UK Infrastructure Bank Bill - 2nd reading**  
Completes the setup of the UK Infrastructure Bank, a state-owned but operationally independent bank that invests in projects to tackle climate change and support regional economic growth. Gives the bank the power to lend directly to local authorities and the Northern Ireland Executive. Started in the Lords.

### WEDNESDAY 2 NOVEMBER

**Microplastic Filters (Washing Machines) Bill**  
Requires manufacturers to fit microplastic-catching filters to new domestic and commercial washing machines, among other things. Ten minute rule motion presented by Alberto Costa.

2 seats are up for election for Michigan supreme court, the two conservatives of the bunch are: 

**Brian Zahra** -currently sitting on the court. During his tenure so far on the state supreme court, he has ruled and dissented conservatively on the issue of abortion and same-sex unions. 

**Paul Hudson** is currently an appellate lawyer in private practice. He has a judicial philosophy that a judge judges and that judge do not create public policy. 

##**Ballot Proposals**

######Prop 3 

**Vote no** - This codifies abortion, even without parental consent, for reasons stretching as far as ""mental health"". 

######Proposal 2

**Vote no** - allowing for ID free voting, and allows for in person voting before election day.

######Proposal 1

**Vote no** - prop would increases term limits to 12 years in each the house and the senate, compared to 12 years total, and mandates any state political official to release their financial information.

So while no boot would be great. And not voting may seem to make a statement. If the bootlickers all vote for the heavy boot, then YOU will still be living with the heavy boot.

So you can tell yourself you didn’t participate and you’re a rebel. But you will still be under their thumb. 

Or you could choice the lesser of 2 evils and try and work with what you have to move them more towards an An-Cap position over time. Because An-Cap isn’t going to happen overnight. It is not some magical land that will just appear. Live with reality.

What does that mean for you?

512,yngpcv,Terrible subs and channels that are deeply brainwashing people with far-left urban propaganda,"Subs like fuckcars and YouTube channels like Not Just Bikes are advocating for the “live in the pods eat the bugs” way of life.

Modern urbanists along with far-left fanatics want to take away your car and force you to live in high-density residential buildings just like how people used to live in the USSR.

It’s easier to control people when they depend on government-owned public transportation and when they’re all crammed in dense overpopulated cities.

The fact that this anti-car urban movement, that is especially indoctrinating vulnerable young people, is gaining traction, is concerning. A dangerous poison for our freedom and independence. 

This has to be a conspiracy. No wonder the algorithms are pushing for pro-urban crap YouTube videos to influence people into thinking that forced collectivization where people no longer own anything and have to share everything is supposedly a good thing.

You don’t get to own a private yard with a pool anymore. You have to use the public pools that are filled with perverts. Want to enjoy privacy outdoors? Your only option is communal spaces or public parks where you find thugs and pedophiles.

With Great Power we will denounce, oppose, criticize and destroy the new urbanism cult that is infesting the whole internet with propaganda that attempts to destroy our precious quality of life.

I see the role of the president of the United States of America as the most difficult job on the planet (we can discuss that, but I think that's the reality), and the issue with that is the fact that establishments want that role to be controlled by someone that they themselves can control. I am definetly and utterly disgusted by the fact that elections are guided on a direction that's not really decided by the population, and I think that Trump being elected before Biden was a glitch. A crack in the castle of glass, a blow of fresh breeze on the castle of cards that the industry established in the past decades. Voting for Trump is not just voting for Trump, the reality is that voting for him is equivalent to fighting a propaganda machine that is trying to destroy everything in regards to the freedom of any individual.This is much bigger than what folks can understand. Trump is the last attempt that people have at their disposal to make a difference. For all the people that can do something about it, and when elections will come, I beg you, do whatever is in your power to try and make others aware of what the world situation is.
Everytime the human race was in a situation of great peril, it all started with a few individuals that were able to advocate for the truth, that were able to make the masses open their eyes on what were the possible scenarios that the world was going towards.
Please, everyone, don't force your vision on others, just challenge their beliefs, understand that 99% of the world is under a spell called propaganda, understand that the minds of the public are brainwashed and instead of going to war against them, challenge their point of views and guide them on a more educated choice.
Constant conflicts between us will never serve a purpose.
We need to fight against the game, not the players.
Use facts against bullshit and kindness against hatred. I myself try continuously to persuade others from going down the rabbit hole that big tech, big pharma, and the industries are trying to guide the folks mind into, and other than that I can't do much more. 
But for everyone that lives in the US and knows other people there, you can make a BIG difference on the results of the next election.
Do a little bit of research, keep some material at hand, ready to demonstrate whatever your point is. Try to see the matter as a help that you give others to understand what's going on, and not a battle between races, political views and all that other bullshit that they want you to be polarized to.

TLDR Just voting is not enough. Do it, preferably in person, and help others to get to an educated decision. Not trying to be dramatic but I think that the entire world depends on the next USA elections",789004940223475575,1

600,xwazhg,Let's analyze the situation in Europe now that Nordstream 2 is gone for the foreseeable future,"We've had [discussions of the Ukraine war and its broader implications at the outset of the war](https://old.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/t4du3r/america_defeats_germany_for_the_third_time_in_a/hyxv4vw/). Now that the Nordstream 2 pipeline has been sabotaged and it is not clear when or even if it can be repaired the situation has accelerated and changed. It is worthwhile and I would say pressing to come to a clear understanding of what this means. So I'm giving my analysis not as some definitive word but just to have some perspective and to get a discussion going.

First people of course want to know who was behind the sabotage. The European and American imperialists were quick at the draw with an answer: the Russians, and don't you dare suggest it was the US. In the grander scheme of things what is important is the dynamics this can unfold in Europe and indeed globally. But we can at least look at the two main suspects and reason through the qui bono. Before that some context. The pipeline was not just a Russian project, it was primarily a joint project of Russia and Germany with other Europeans both involved and opposed. It was a crucial project for German imperialism to ensure not just constant and cheap energy supply, but to forge a deeper and lasting alliance with Russia. The Eastern Europeans, Ukraine in particular, were opposed to the pipeline because by circumventing these countries they would lose transfer costs they still receive otherwise - for Germany in turn this would have meant even lower energy costs. So this was not simply an attack on Russian infrastructure, it was an attack on German imperialism and Europe at large as it substantially undermines its energy security, thus its independence from the US and the prosperity of its industries.

The reasoning produced by bourgeois media regarding Russia's motivation goes as follows: The Russians have leverage over Europe by means of their supply of resources. They want to use this leverage, but not openly so. Thus they sabotaged their own pipeline to put pressure on Europe, and they blame the US to split the Euro-American alliance. The problem with the reasoning is evident: by blowing up the pipelines the Russians would have blown up their own leverage, not used it, but negated it while also losing customers who are only becoming more desperate for their resources in spite of all the posturing. But even the motivation is questionable, since the West is already in open war with Russia, they are openly supplying arms and funds to Ukraine and [buying out the entire country for decades to come](https://thenextrecession.wordpress.com/2022/08/13/ukraine-the-invasion-of-capital/). Why would the Russians not simply turn off the pipelines openly, or do so again with a thinly veiled pretense as they did with Nordstream 1 so that everyone understands the message, rather than actually blowing it up and destroying their leverage.

The US on the other hand has been rallying against the construction of the pipeline  ever since its was conceived. Why? Because it works towards the creation of one of their biggest geostrategic nightmares, the alliance of Russian resources and German capital and industry which creates a genuine threat to US imperialism. We've all seen the [clips of Biden](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FVbEoZXhCrM) and [Nuland openly announcing that they will find a way to shut down the pipeline](https://detv.us/2022/01/28/victoria-nuland-threatens-to-shut-down-nord-stream-2-if-russia-invades-ukraine-rt-en/) from earlier this year, but the background to these threats are much deeper. NATO itself has as one of its main functions the purpose of [keeping Germany and Russia at arms length](https://www.counterfire.org/articles/history/18584-keep-the-russians-out-the-americans-in-and-the-germans-down-a-potted-and-bloody-history-of-nato). And precisely this was being undermined by the existence of the pipeline, at a time when German industry has already conquered Europe and while the US is in rapid decline. Now that the pipeline is destroyed, so is this danger gone for the immediate future.

This leads me to the larger point. I think to make sense of this whole war we have to be conscious that the US has been preparing for the war against China for almost two decades by now. This is what necessitates the radicalism of US foreign policy. With [Obama's strategic Pivot to Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian_foreign_policy_of_the_Barack_Obama_administration) a new phase in this preparation was started, now the coming conflict informs every move of the US bourgeoisie and their political agents. Prior to the pipeline sabotage I thought the main goal was to lure Russia into the conflict, which ought to internally destabilize it and depose Putin, opening the way for a US comprador who could then [dismantle Russia into a number of helpless small nations](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/russia-putin-colonization-ukraine-chechnya/639428/). Now I'm starting to think the primary target was actually Europe, particularly Germany, not Russia (which remains the a secondary goal).

For some time now there have been efforts to bring industry back to the US. Recently there is [the program of repatriating chip production to the US](https://mronline.org/2022/08/09/u-s-china-chip-war-continues/), but to goal has to be larger in order to prepare for the large scale confrontation with China. And that's where the sabotage of Nordstream 2 pipeline does wonders for the US. It creates a renewed dependence of another imperialist block that was becoming increasingly alienated from the US ever since the creation of the EU. At the same time it destroys the industries of Europe, who now will no longer have the necessary resources to continue production. Even if they change to American natural gas the price will be 7 to 8 fold than that of Russian gas, which would raise the cost of production to a level that might simply be no longer competitive. Indeed [industries have already started](https://www-handelsblatt-com.translate.goog/technik/it-internet/wirtschaftspolitik-deutsche-unternehmen-bauen-ihre-standorte-in-den-usa-immer-weiter-aus-/28697464.html?nlayer=Technologie-News_3684670&_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=de&_x_tr_pto=wapp) moving [from Europe to the US](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/09/europe-faces-an-exodus-of-energy-intensive-industries.html). *So the destruction of European industry works directly in favor of re-industrialization of the US.* [Michael Hudson reckons that Europe has effectively lost an entire decade of development](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/09/michael-hudson-on-the-euro-without-germany.html) due to the destruction of the pipelines. And now that Europe will no longer be competitive nor independent of the US it also is of less use for China, as its living standards falls and thus its potential purpose as a market for complex products will dwindle. Seemingly a success for the US all along the line.

This, btw. was one of the horror visions of Engels. In a letter to Sorge from January 7, 1888 while thinking through a potential world war he considered the option of Europe becoming entwined in a prolonged internal conflict that would lead to US industry overtaking it. In that case Engels saw two options: either Europe would de-industrialize as it would no longer be competitive with US industry and thus become one of the domains of US imperialism, or it would overthrow its bourgeoisie and finally enter into socialist transition. This just as an interesting detail.

To the consequences for the coming development. Europe will fall into a deep and prolonged economic and social crisis. This, of course, heightens the trends towards fascization, likely to a critical degree. The fascists will use the crisis to argue to move away from the US and towards the east (thus isolating the US), they will use it to discredit not just the established bourgeois faction who created this crisis in the first place with its obedience to US dictates, they will use it to discredit bourgeois democracy in its entirety. Certainly a section of the established, US aligned political caste will switch tone and abandon the US. [Merkel, who was one of the last intelligent imperialist politicians of some actual stature, already remarked](https://www.german-foreign-policy.com/news/detail/9040) that Germany shouldn't just give up on Nordstream 2 (it still doesn't seem to be clear if it can be repaired after all). It remains to be seen just how strong bourgeois democracy is in Europe, I would not rule out that it can survive this crisis by coming this close to fascism without actually tipping into it. The other trend that will emerge, I think, is an actual revolutionary left. With the deep and broad impoverishment that this crisis will bring the conditions for such an actual left are finally recreated and much faster than would have happened otherwise. In this sense this terrorist attack by the US on Europe (by US I'm including its proxies, who may have done it for them, [say Poland for example](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/09/the-bornholm-blow-up-repeats-the-bornholm-bash-poland-attacks-germany-and-blames-russia.html)) could well turn out to be a godsend by the American bourgeoisie to the world proletariat. These are the struggles that the left in Europe has to prepare for. They have to make concrete studies of how these tendencies will work themselves out within the context of their given society, how they can affect them in favor of overcoming the bourgeois order.

I know this already got too long for a forum post, but it deserves still much more detailed analysis (I'm cutting it short intentionally so that someone will still read it at all, also because I don't have too much time). Hopefully we can work towards something like it in a discussion. I'm totally open to reasoned disagreements.

E: Almost forgot that I wanted to tag u/TheRedMarxist in this.

E2: Update: [according to fascist German politicians](https://twitter.com/Alice_Weidel/status/1577960036613201920?cxt=HHwWgIC9wd-SheYrAAAA) there's still a functional line of Nordstream 2 and the Russians have offered to supply gas through it. German media aligned with the government coalition (which is close to the entire media) has not reported on this. But this will turn out to be a significant bit of leverage by the German fascists which they can use to push their agenda. [There's already been demonstrations in Germany](https://www-jungewelt-de.translate.goog/artikel/435564.gegen-hohe-energiepreise-wut-in-ostdeutschland.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=de&_x_tr_pto=wapp) with people demanding the government to drop the sanctions on Russia and open Nordstream 2, demonstrations largely lead by fascist forces.

I've also added some more links in case people want to get a more concrete picture (which I'd recommend, of course).

E3: [New source on the still working Nordstream 2 line and the Russian offer](https://www.dw.com/en/putin-offers-europe-gas-through-nord-stream-2-germany-declines/a-63416138 ) (already denied by the Germans, but we'll see as the social pressure mounts). Also mentions that it will take at least one year to repair the pipelines. This is not that long, but I'm not sure how it will influence Russia's actions in the war, if they prolong it with that in sight, speculating that Germans will change course, or if its too long for them. Putin's following suggestion might point to the former option:

> ""We could move the lost volumes from the Nord Streams along the bottom of the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea region and thus make the main routes for the supply of our fuel, our natural gas to Europe through Turkey, creating the largest gas hub for Europe in Turkey,"" 

This has to be read as another offer to Germany in particular, as German capital and politics is intimately entwined with Turkey's comprador bourgeoisie. Ukraine has already suggested destroying the existing Russian pipeline running through Turkey, and there was already one such attempt. I think Russia also doesn't want to fall completely into dependency on China, with the potential of simply becoming its resource colony. By keeping the European connection alive it also maintains political and economic room for maneuverability.

There was also another sabotage attack in Germany, this time on the public transport system. [Here's an analysis](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/10/whose-cat-caught-the-german-tongue-no-blame-for-russia-after-german-train-sabotage-on-sunday-morning-no-blame-for-nord-stream-sabotage-yet.html) which points out two things: (1) German politics is shy on putting the blame for this on Russia so far, and (2) the growing tensions and shifts within the government and German political landscape at large.

And [there was yet another damaged pipeline](https://www.dw.com/en/poland-reports-leak-in-oil-pipeline-to-germany/a-63410763), a Russian crude oil one running through Poland to supply Europe in general and Germany in particular. AfD, the German fascist party, already put the accident in doubt, suggesting it was sabotage. They're probably right, I'd wager, as Poland is the strongest partner of the US in mainland Europe and has obvious historical reasons to hate German imperialism. Poles are suggesting it was once again the Russians sabotaging their own pipeline, naturally.

Finally [this is a bit of a longer piece on the deep economic and social effects of the crises](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/10/protests-are-growing-across-europe-as-inflation-surges-and-economic-crisis-deepens.html), both regarding the energy supply and the inflation. Particularly interesting regarding France and Germany. If you've heard about the gas protests in France, this is some good background to check out.

> Not only is inflation raging but economic activity is grinding to a standstill. Legions of small and medium sized businesses, still shouldering heavy debts after the lockdowns of 2020, are facing an existential crisis.

> [...] **Of greatest concern is the Euro Area’s largest economy, Germany, whose industrial backbone is massively dependent on cheap sources of abundant energy, which no longer exist thanks to the recent rupturing of Nordstream I and II.**

Global Times has an opinion piece on the growing tendencies towards a turn away from the US along with the danger of falling completely under its hegemony (they probably correctly aleardy give up on the UK in this regard). It's called *Europe awakes to US sabotage of its autonomy* and includes this remarkable piece of information:

> In the first eight months of this year, European companies' investment in China surged by 123.7 percent. Many European manufacturing giants continue to bet part of their future on cooperation with China, and they are expressing their attitude toward Europe's China policy with their actions.",-275544864150723469,0

As I was looking at a chart on life expectancy in Russia from the mid 1800's's up to modern times (https://www.statista.com/statistics/1041395/life-expectancy-russia-all-time/), I noticed a certain period that I'm curious about. 

One can obviously observe an increasing trend with hiccups along the way that led to the trends slowing down or decreasing temporarily, e.g. the Russian civil war, WW2, etc. After WW2, yet after these, one can observe a very accelerated and significant increase in life expectancy, yet it's then faced with a very abrupt halt between the late 50's, early 60's, followed by a significant decrease in life expectancy after Gorbachev's introduction of neoliberal reforms into the nation, followed by an increase again after many years. And from there, whe're at current times.

But what was exactly happening in the 50's-60's that led to that initial halt? Was there a major change or a chain of events that signified this stop, or was this trend more of a reflection on the limitations of the medicinal sciences of the times?",9173520086296325292,0

afaik The Philippines is the most advanced site of revolutionary struggle. Communists are popular and active in Sudan. The same is being built in Kenya. Latin America is tricky because of it's proximity to the US and saturation with US military bases, however there is a very high level of class consciousness, and the shining resilience of Cuba that many movements aspire to.

Since Capital is a ""critique of political economy"" I'm wondering to what extent it's worth reading the major works of Smith and Ricardo in order to fully understand Capital. As dialectical materialists, we recognize that our philosophy is necessary to present an accurate reflection of material reality, so I am a bit hesitant to tell myself that it is necessary to read the major political economists that preceded Marx in order to understand capitalism; as an expression of dialectical materialism, I expect that Capital itself is adequate to get at the essence of it. On the other hand, if Capital is intended as a critique of political economy, I feel that I should understand the content that Marx is critiquing. Moreover, I wonder if there is much in the major works of Smith and Ricardo that isn't touched on by Marx, since it had already been developed previously? Would love some context.

648,ybi14c,Questions for Chinese People,"I am currently in China and will be spending some time here making some observations for personal research. Please leave in the comments any questions you would like me to ask Chinese people. Certain questions involving deep knowledge of theory (e.g. what do you think of Trotsky) I will try to ask officials and professors who should theoretically be able to answer. Other questions that do not involve anything complex (what do you think of this controversy reported in Western media?) I will ask normal people. Please do not ask me for personal information. I will not answer.

After spending a bit of time here, my initial impression is that China is indeed a ""third world country"" in every sense of the word. The g7 are put on a pedestal. White people from the G7 are treated like celebrities to varying degrees. The ""rise of xenophobia"" BS you see on the internet is nonsense. Living conditions are similar to other poor countries, the big exceptions are infrastructure and safety, which are better than most countries.

There is immense confusion as regards Marxist theory. I visited a university. The professors are split between bourgeois theory (which is euphemistically referred to as mainstream theory) and Marxist theory (most seem to be supporting the former). Those supporting the former are obviously anti-communists, but for obvious reasons do not directly speak out against the government. I assume that politically they are a mix between ""reformers"" and counter-revolutionaries.

The Marxists (professional academic ones) are eclectic. Karl Marx once said, ""The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e. the class which is the ruling material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectual force."" The leading material and therefore intellectual force today globally is undoubtedly the American bourgeoisie. Universities all around the world (including China) use American textbooks in the social science curriculums. This is already a bit shocking for those who don't know better. What genuinely shocked me was to find Marxists agreeing with and promoting David Harvey, Paul Sweezy, and Modern Monetary Theory (this last one does not even pretend to be Marxist)! I used to think Western Marxism was only of interest to petite-bourgeois academics in the West. I was wrong.

The countries targeted by the G7 in today's world often have reactionary political/economic systems. This leads to confusion among the left (e.g. what should the left's stance be toward the Syrian government?). The confusion stems from the fact that the country's position may be progressive from the standpoint of the global economic system, but the same country can have regressive domestic policies. There is even more confusion regarding China since it is ruled by the CPC.  To be fair, the Chinese people themselves are also confused. Chinese students are confused as to why, despite the fact that their country's official ideology is Marxism-Leninism, anti-Marxist theories are predominant in universities. Knowledge of contemporary imperialism (either in the liberal sense of military aggression or the Leninist sense) is almost non-existent among ordinary people and even party officials. I once met a CPC member who works in government who had never read the Communist Manifesto ( this member had time to study abroad in England however!) Despite this, Xi Jinping in one of his recent journal articles wrote something along the lines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin did not expect that we would have to manage a socialist market...We are still revolutionaries and must uphold our revolutionary tradition. Propaganda that supports socialism is also everywhere. Occasionally I even hear on the street a siren reminding people to remember socialist values.

Unfortunately, it has been my experience that anybody critical towards the CPC leans towards liberalism. Many of these people are confused as opposed to being genuine reactionaries. When I start explaining basic Marxist concepts to them, they are instantly fully supportive (in contradistinction to many Westerners who are taught to despise communism).

Finally, I will say that our situation objectively right now is not great. Since the fall of the USSR (arguably since the late 1950s), the global left has been theoretically confused and pessimistic about the future. China is not an exception to this rule. It is my hope that the young generation can make the final push towards human liberation. Anyone who has anything positive to say about developments in other countries please leave it in the comments.

I am writing a paper for class comparing and contrasting the characteristics of the 1936 Arab Uprising in Palestine and the recent 2021 general strike in response to Israeli brutal aggression in Gaza. If you didn't know, this was the first time in almost 100 years that geographically separated Palestinians mass participated in a general strike together. It cost the Israeli economy 30 million in damages and revealed the occupation's dependence on Palestinian workers who are often paid in shit wages, bad working conditions, humiliating border-crossing, etc.

&#x200B;

I'm writing this essay to demonstrate that while most foreign actors or states attempt to reduce the occupation to a religious issue, that it is also a class-based issue on top of a colonial one, feminist one, imperialist one, etc.  I aim to write specifically about the class part.

&#x200B;

I'm looking for any accounts or articles about the 2021 strikes (can be in other languages) or academic articles exploring the link between Israel's capitalist expansion and the exploitation of Palestinian workers.

655,y9epgr,My argument against electoralism/voting,"My case against electoralism/voting.

I've seen a rise in electoralism in leftist spaces in recent times, I think no doubt to people like Contra et al, but I'd like to state a few reasons for why the whole electoral game is bankrupt due to scale and inherent contradictions.



1. It requires enormous energy and investment to win.

Voting isn't simply about the individual votes, on the scale of a national or regional election you're talking thousands if not millions of votes. That's why parties instead focus more on the voting blocks to garner support. For this you need a lot of time and money and labour to succeed and get your candidate in the running. In other words you need a very well organised and costly campaign that may not necessarily succeed.

Socialists should not be looking towards entering this system that is very susceptible to corruption, opportunism, and inefficiencies over time. Rather invest their labour and money in other direct action ventures that can challenge the system and maybe by a secondary measure influence electoral politics. The ultimate truth of electoralism is 'If you don't CAMPAIGN, you can't COMPLAIN' because in order for the candidate to get ANYWHERE there needs to be lots of funding and organising behind it to get a mass group of people voting for you. And for that, it requires you engage in that campaign to make it work, not JUST VOTE.



2. Social change comes from the societal conditions first and foremost.

People often state that the more left wing candidate will be able to be more effective when it comes to workers rights and change. Yet as we can see throughout history this was more due to the circumstances involved. The New Deal came in response to the crashed economy, the post war reforms in the UK were held by both parties, there was far greater organised labour to bargain, and many repressed groups were also fighting for their say in the nation's affairs.

The rise of Reagan and Thatcher was a response to the downturn in the economy and a need for reshuffling in order to sustain profiteering into the future.  

It’s not to say that history is deterministic, but that the change doesn’t occur at electorate level, it's always driven by much larger factors. Gay marriage, The renters reform bill, and even ACORN UK all came about, or were funded  by initiatives from… a tory government. And now it appears like they're on the way out.

3. The goals and aims of the left are not the same as the right.

The right-wings gains from electoralism are always used as a reason for why the left should engage more with electoral politics and win elections, if they can do it, so should we.

Ignoring what I said in part 1, or that we don't have as much money, lets also remember that the instrument that sustains the system, will not be very effective as a means to destroy it. The right can always lean on the status quo ante and bolster it, the left on the other hand has the much harder job of destroying the very roots of that system. Part of why the left is so divided is because everyone has different ideas about how to go about this and what society should look like, the right already has the foundations of that set firmly, it just needs to retreat to them, hence they tend to get along without too many arguments.

4. It creates opportunism and stagnation.

People might think that a more left centre politician might create a greater avenue for making change, however often the electoral game simply co-opts and recuperates these issues.

Roe vs Wade being overturned for example allows the perfect opportunity for Democrats to bring people into the political game and give themselves a career boost. In other words, the injustice becomes an opportunity, in the same way that many charities depend upon the problems they intend to solve in order to exist.

Similarly, having a strong Conservative party allows the Scottish National Party to scapegoat their problems onto them. If Scotland were independent that would be much harder to do. I'm not saying that's the reason they don't attempt an independence referendum again, but its understandable to see why they wouldn't attempt to remove all doubt, especially when you notice what happened to the Liberal Democrats when they shared power.

It's easy to see why if a left-wing politician were to gain power that the situation would simply become a matter of them sustaining power whilst implementing small reforms here and there, whilst beating off more radical groups and energies that wish to go further.



5. It destroys the focus on the left from radical aims into a door-to-door canvasing endeavour.

I'll just let Libcom explain this better than I can.

 Every criticism of 'abolish the family' as a slogan imagines the socialist as stranger, no connection to their listener who has little/no prior knowledge and disengages when they hear something they don't like (rather than ask Qs): this is the doorstep socialism of electoralism 

 Might these be conversations with friends/workmates? Long term relationships where people say ""well, they might be a mad bastard but not all wrong""? No, just ""what would they say if I knocked the door and said 'I'm campaigning for X; how do you feel about abolishing the family'?"" 

 This is politics imagined as an elevator pitch: if you don't immediately say what the stranger wants to hear, they'll close the door on you. If that's your politics, ok; but that's not the end of socialist ideas (let alone activity!) 

 Point is, if you have radical politics, you're always gonna be a bit of an outlier. But the point of socialism/communism/whatever politics is to build relationships & your non-politico mates/workmates (fuck, even your fellow activists!) don't have to swallow your worldview whole   



6. It's not as simple as 'Do both'

The argument that 'WE CAN DO BOTH' is complicated by the fact that its always weighted on the reformist side.

A line has emerged in recent times - ""Do radical actions WHEN they come about, Do reform IN THE MEANTIME"" which is probably one of the more impoverished statements I've ever heard.

If we actually want to move things forward we have to create the circumstances for those radical actions, and perhaps do reform as a side activity if it is clear and convenient (referendums). So the statement should be ""Do reform WHEN things come about, Do Radical Actions IN THE MEAN TIME!""


What I will say though is that voter apathy only works if that apathy is being funnelled into a different channel, Not voting alone doesn't change the system either. So other avenues need to be created in order for that to work. The problem is people simply insist ""Oh we don't have those yet"" which becomes a self-fulfilling philosophy that basically amounts to ""We won't ever have them"" because such people are not interested in developing the bases in the first place... because they don't exist.",-631771007424558410,0

Basically the pact was offered by the Nazis for the USSR to become a fourth axis power and be allowed a sphere of influence from the Middle East to India and Asia. It was turned down outright and Molotov spent a couple of days in Berlin negotiating and ultimately the Germans didn’t accept the counter offer of the USSR maintaining influence in Europe and at the end refused to respond to the USSR despite being asked several times. Throughout Soviet times the common narrative was that Stalin was testing the Germans and there was a publication that’s said to have been edited by Stalin himself saying as much until 1991.

Broken promises regarding NATO's expansion eastward, and seeking to confine Russia geopolitically to the point where they strangle them.

All this imperialism narrative serves to do is to make Putin (who is no doubt an oligarch and thug) into a cartoon Hitler 2.0 and absolve the West of complicity in their antagonism. NATO  has been training Ukrainian troops by the thousands since 2014. Ukraine has permitted fascists to march on their streets, supported by local officials. They have attacked civilians in the Donbass. Yet, now they are the darlings of the west.

> But while the bourgeoisie chooses the path of war, the working class in the capitalist countries, brought to despair by four years of crisis and unemployment, is beginning to take the path of revolution. This means that a revolutionary crisis is maturing and will continue to mature. And the more the bourgeoisie becomes entangled in its war schemes, the more frequently it resorts to terrorist methods of fighting against the working class and the labouring peasantry, the more rapidly will the revolutionary crisis develop.

> Some comrades think that, once there is a revolutionary crisis, the bourgeoisie is bound to get into a hopeless position, that its end is therefore a foregone conclusion, that the victory of the revolution is thus assured, and that all they have to do is to wait for the fall of the bourgeoisie and to draw up victorious resolutions. That is a profound mistake. The victory of the revolution never comes of itself. It must be prepared for and won. And only a strong proletarian revolutionary party can prepare for and win victory. Moments occur when the situation is revolutionary, when the rule of the bourgeoisie is shaken to its very foundations, and yet the victory of the revolution does not come, because there is no revolutionary party of the proletariat with sufficient strength and prestige to lead the masses and to take power. It would be unwise to believe that such ""cases"" cannot occur.

> It is worth while in this connection to recall Lenin's prophetic words on revolutionary crisis, uttered at the Second Congress of the Communist International:

> > ""We have now come to the question of the revolutionary crisis as the basis of our revolutionary action. And here we must first of all note two widespread errors. On the one hand, the bourgeois economists depict this crisis as mere ‘unrest,' as the English so elegantly express it. On the other hand, revolutionaries sometimes try to prove that the crisis is absolutely hopeless. That is a mistake. There is no such thing as an absolutely hopeless situation. The bourgeoisie behaves like an arrogant plunderer who has lost his head; it commits folly after folly, making the situation more acute and hastening its own doom. All this is true. But it cannot be ‘proved' that there is absolutely no chance of its gulling some minority of the exploited with some kind of minor concessions, or of suppressing some movement or uprising of some section or another of the oppressed and exploited. To try to ‘prove' beforehand that a situation is ‘absolutely' hopeless would be sheer pedantry, or juggling with concepts and catchwords. In this and similar questions the only real ‘proof' is practice. The bourgeois system all over the world is experiencing a most profound revolutionary crisis. The revolutionary parties must now ‘prove' by their practical actions that they are sufficiently intelligent and organised, are sufficiently in contact with the exploited masses, are sufficiently determined and skilful, to utilise this crisis for a successful and victorious revolution"" (Lenin, Vol. XXV, pp. 340-41).

I thought it could be worthwhile bringing this up again because there's a certain fatalism about this new structural crisis of the capitalist world system taking a hold among the left, I get the impression. Faced with the lack of any substantially organized revolutionary left in the imperialist countries some seek refuge in the illusion that capitalism will just collapse on its own. Theories of capitalism's final collapse like Luxemburg's and Grossmann's are becoming more popular among intellectuals, which I'd say is an expression of this weakness, where the theory then serves as a means to alleviate the pain of this terrible situation or actually mystify it into a strength. In this sense it is worth pointing out that both Luxemburg and Grossmann also understood their theories not as arguments for fatalism, but as arguments for why the working class has to become organized and prevent this final collapse, which would hurt the oppressed and exploited people the most.",-275544864150723469,0

I'd recommend reading [Why Socialism](https://speakoutsocialists.org/wp-content/uploads/Einstein-Why-Socialism-web.pdf); an article by Albert Einstein. This article is more on our modern Society answering why we humans accept socialism and how it is inevitable. 

Socialism is the idea and concept of the workers owning the mean of production, distribution, and exchange. It is the most common definition but I’m taking the Marxist definition. The necessary step to communism, and bringing the workers' power to the top. I would be avoiding the definitions from some people being that being [Social Democracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lDZaKjfs4E) is the same as socialism.

Let's first check socialism and capitalism and compare both. The USA is known as the icon of capitalism, and the USSR (1922–1991) is the icon of socialism. Let us check the US literacy rate. 79% is the literacy rate of the US in 2022. The USSR? About 100% by the 1950s. That is success in education. Point 1: socialism

Sources: [Liebowitz, Ronald (1986). Education and Literacy Data in Russian and Soviet Censuses](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctt1g69xfv.13), 

Now, let us check healthcare and healthcare affordability. In the USA, the average ambulance is 1200 USD (not including insurance; when included, it is 450 USD), and 56% of the nation cannot pay for 1000 USD in medical emergencies, let alone an ambulance ride. 265 dollars for just talking to the doctor. The USSR? Healthcare was free, and all Soviet citizens were happy. Point 2: socialism

Sources: [US cost of ambulances](https://www.talktomira.com/post/how-much-does-an-ambulance-ride-cost-without-insurance#:~:text=Bottom%20Line,the%20type%20of%20supplies%20used.), [CNN article about 56% of all US citizens cannot afford a 1000$ emergency](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/19/56percent-of-americans-cant-cover-a-1000-emergency-expense-with-savings.html), [Healthcare of the USSR and its costs](https://books.google.co.in/books?hl=en&lr=&id=cfI6AAAAIAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA3&dq=Leichter,+Howard+M.:+A+Comparative+Approach+to+Policy+Analysis:+Health+Care+Policy+in+Four+Nations&ots=VkCh9FHEe0&sig=25CSSzR-ntfs6LXJxw8oeFP1CEM&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Leichter%2C%20Howard%20M.%3A%20A%20Comparative%20Approach%20to%20Policy%20Analysis%3A%20Health%20Care%20Policy%20in%20Four%20Nations&f=false)

Now our final comparison of socialism and capitalism is the QOL of the nation. Socialist nations, compared to capitalist nations, In socialist nations, the quality of life is better and development is better, according to a study by the authors [S Cereseto](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/S.-Cereseto/13731260), [Howard Waitzkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Waitzkin). 

Source: [Capitalism, socialism, and the physical quality of life](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2430906/)

Now one question is how about the black book of communism? Well, I made an article on that, it talks about [the black book and western democracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/yhage5/a_critique_of_the_black_book_and_western_democracy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Socialism is better in always when comparing Education, Healthcare, and general quality of life. How about freedom? Well, it depends on our definition, is being debt trapped for going to the hospital freedom? Is not being to afford home freedom? To my definition: You have the right to food, shelter, water, cloth, healthcare, and education. That is freedom, Not the right to wave the confederate flag. Well, why is socialism inevitable? Well, to quote Rosa Luxemburg it is either Socialism or Barbarism. We, humans, have the tendency to think it is the end of history. No, it is not. History won't end till a billion or 2 years. Our way of society and material analysis of our world must come to a standard. I’d recommend this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVWwwfcQ5FA) talks about historical materialism.

728,ymkuk6,Economists say this isn’t another Great Depression. I agree—this is a Greater Depression.,"Humankind has more wealth and power in its possession than at any time in recorded history. Instead of uplifting the people who made and continue to make that possible, businesses and governments write workers off, blame them, and then forget about them. 

The media says people on the Left are “too woke” and out-of-touch. I can’t help but think of the irony; the media, which relies on its influence over “consumers” rests its laurels on the broken pillars of a failing government ready to make way for Q-Anon followers and Stop the Steal militiamen. 

While all of this foolishness plays out before us, no government stands up to address the deteriorating mental health of its people. We who survived COVID-19, we who live with the grim realities of economic catastrophe every 5 to 7 years. We who live with the reality of Right-Wing gunmen shooting up schools, houses of worship, and pushing their narratives of White Supremacy and Christian-Identity.

It doesn’t matter how much we compromise in our lives, or how much we attempt to appease our bosses, managers, and government—the fault rests with the worker. They will fire us. They will let us go. They will tell the public they have bad workers, “They were quiet quitting! No one wants to work anymore!” It will all be to appease their shareholders and customers—-they have to raise their prices while cutting down on labor costs. 

Yes, comrades—this is the Greater Depression. The managers of it are smiling because they know it’s rude to scowl. They can be certain of their victories before a battle has even begun. Their greatest asset is their ability to wield the chaos of their broken workers’ lives to fulfill an agenda bent to the benefit of the wealthy and powerful. 

All we really have is each other. Not as philosophers, political theoreticians, or pundits. As workers. As the Proletariat. We must unite to stand up to those who seek to exploit and use us. Not because we will assuredly win, but because we will have nothing to lose. One who is lost, cannot be found; the lost must find their own way. We will find our way.

Our natural determination, as able-bodied humans, to stand upright, is our noble defiance countering the forces that hold our feet to the ground. It is not shameful to demand respect, to appraise one’s own worth over profit, or to challenge the greed and wickedness of those who have more money than morality.",-5909349236670612998,0

So, we’ve talked about unionising and had discussions with UNITE whilst some of our lab workers are already members of Prospect union which represents scientists and engineers etc.

The catch is that our company doesn’t recognise unions (surprise surprise). Now, I understand that by law we can apply for recognition and if the company refuses then we can get statutory recognition provided we have at least 10% of our bargaining unit paid union members and a majority of them in favour of recognition. 

My plan therefore is to recruit more members in the short term and build up a solid membership base in the manufacturing and lab departments of the company. I estimate that we can get ~80% of both of those departments paid union members which should provide us with a bargaining unit that the company cannot ignore. 

If anyone has any additional advice or thoughts on this please let me know. I would love to talk to other U.K. union members and particularly those at other pharma companies. Many thanks and solidarity to all ✊🚩",-3128033307576724731,0

766,yl2tue,"Reduced motivation for crimes, ""In a just and equitable human society""","In a just and equitable human society, there would be none marginalized, and therefore no motivation to break the established social contract and commit a crime. You would have to have a serious psychiatric condition to commit a crime in such an environment, so no prisons would theoretically be needed, but hospitals might. But that would require society as a whole to value all human life equally.

The establishment of new police forces or increasing police presence has never been statistically shown to have any relevant or beneficial impact on crime rates. The purpose of police departments are generally much more corrupt than crime control - they were first designed, formed, and funded in the US by factory and slave owners hoping for better \*social\* control of their respective labor forces. It wasn't until the 1830's that corporations or other organizations were first able to ""persuade"" local governments to fund their private militias (or ""enforcers"") with taxpayer dollars, to save money on enforcing the proper behavior of labor forces they desired further distance from. Corporations were so successful in their propaganda, that the original name for employees peacefully protesting for better working conditions is now considered far more derogatory ( a ""riot"" ), and they generally no longer even use this term but prefer to describe their actions as ""strikes"".

Similarly, studies have failed to find any significant correlation between incarceration rates and crime rates. 3 million Americans enslaved in prisons, and it's had no effect on crime rates, but has provided cheap slave labor. The 13th amendment luckily carves out a loophole in the ban on slavery and indentured servitude, allowing it for anyone convicted of a crime. We're also lucky that such great lawmakers were able to come up with some very creative new crimes specifically for people of color after the civil war reconstruction period ended, prohibition after WWI, a war on drugs after the civil rights era in the 60s, etc.

But the real key is that it's estimated that 3 out of every 4 incarcerated Americans has a severe psychiatric condition that has never been properly diagnosed or treated. The prisons keep these people safely off the streets where they could be costing taxpayer dollars to treat their various conditions.

This will hopefully allow everyone to get to know each other outside of our political views and discuss anything non-political. You never know, you may actually have similar interests! So to keep in the spirit of our authoritarianism, there are a few things first:

1. The subject matter is to try and stay away from politics please

2. Feel free to ask anything

3. New members are more than welcome to contribute, and this may be a chance to introduce yourself to the sub!

[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-63526167](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-63526167)

It's like he's half-way towards a decent point, that the way you fix NHS staffing is by expanding training in the NHS (though how we do that while we allow the private sector to poach the expensive staff we train, as Streeting's repeatedly pledged, is beyond me).

The problem is that immigration is irrelevant to this: fixing the NHS is a question of both/and, not either/or.

And I realise that there will be some telling us that this is 11D chess involving showing that Labour is somehow ""strong"" on immigration but there are strong arguments that the long term effect of this centrist triangulation are largely negative: Blair's approach here for example led to a provable long-term decline in Labour's vote, it's deeply debateable that it had any effect on the Tory vote, which almost certainly just joined parties like UKIP instead of Labour and [evidence globally is that it leads to a resurgent far right](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2019/09/16/the-brahmin-left-vs-the-merchant-right-a-comment-on-thomas-pikettys-new-book/).

So really all he's done here is promise to undermine the health service by unnecessarily limiting its staffing while putting all the emphasis on the myth that ""concerns about immigration"" are at all respectable.",142556151057227929,0

[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bs1K5rqbNY) his full speech from the ""SME4Labour"" gala.

Catch the bit from 2:15 - 3:05.

>""We had to make our Labour party fit to serve our country. And a huge part of that, a huge part of that right up there, with everything we've done for NATO and national security, is **showing to the British people that this party wants businesses to PROSPER. That we respect the contribution that profit makes, to jobs, to growth, and the taxes which pay for our Public Services.** 

>**We understand that we can only build a fairer, greener Britain by backing the Enterprises that you have built to the hilt.** ""That's why I feel so proud when I see rooms like this, because it shows that we've changed the party.""

And that's just the beginning. He says a lot more after that about his plans for Labour's relationship with business. 

At 3:53

>**Because if we cant to drive our country forward, we need a real partnership between state and market, business and unions. Town and City.** That's how we tackle the country's challenges. By pulling everyone in the same direction. Everyone contributing to a fairer, greener future.

He talked a lot about which areas a Labour government's gonna focus on(Entrepreneurs, green growth, skilling etc) but he didn't mention any new policies other than the ones Labour's already announced, like abolishing business rates. But still I got a lot more detail than I knew before.

----

I thought overall he hit it out of the park. If you're from the business community, an entrepreneur etc. or just work in the private sector you need to see this speech. He really gets what he needs to do for the economy. He's really accepted the role of Labour as a friend and partner of business. :D",-5199389251710428891,0

It isn't simply ""workers vs billionaires"" in Britain","I have highlighted a comment posted here that has over 400 upvotes at current from the recent ""British attitudes to wealth"" thread because it touches on something fundamental to the British economy, from housing crisis to wage stagnation - in turn, understanding this concept collectively is something that can make the left either an effective force or completely inept. The post can be seen here:  [https://imgur.com/a/SlgegHq](https://imgur.com/a/SlgegHq)

The idea that ""we're all in it together"" (anyone remember that phrase?) as a group of workers vs the evil billionaires, no matter whether you're on 10k or 200k is a nice notion, but it is also a nonsense that's used to make sure effective change cannot happen.

Whether you want to call them PMCs (professional managerial classes), bourgeoisie or any other collective terminology, ""workers"" in the upper wage margins are largely not political allies. They have become part of a different class due to their ability to acquire capital - capital which is then used to make normal people's lives more difficult.

The massive decrease in bargaining power for working class people in Britain since the 80s (since industry was destroyed and union membership subsequently attacked/collapsed) has lead to a direct increase in the bargaining power of PMCs (eg £150k a year people).

This has created a massive chasm between the spending and purchasing power of people on lower or median wages, and those on higher incomes. In turn, we see housing crisis, and wage stagnation because working class people are priced out of the market by PMCs who can afford to buy assets like land and housing not to live in, but as a speculative asset to generate profit.

If you have a business of 200 people for example, you have to pay all your workers - skilled or unskilled (I know those terms aren't great but I'm using them for the sake of argument). A unionised workforce can collectively bargain for better wages, meaning there's less in the wage pot for the professional managerial classes - they'll still earn plenty, but they'll earn less - and this is something they don't want.

Because of the destruction of working class people's bargaining power (again, via the far less unionised labour, attacks on the social safety net, pop growth), we've seen a political shift that has normalised psychotic politics like neoliberalism and austerity - these policies **benefit the professional managerial classes while taking from normal and working class people. This is true in both the Tory party and the right wing of the Labour party.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Want to understand why New Labour under Blair had a worse record on inequality than Thatcher and built zero council houses, creating housing crisis?

Want to understand why Keir Starmer is funded by billionaires and hedgefund managers and gives 6 figure payouts to those who intentionally sabotaged Labour's electoral prospects from within the party?

Want to understand why Tory MPs are being invited to the Labour party across the floor while simultaneously suggesting ""we all need to vote labour to get these horrible Tories out"". Why Nye Bevan, a former coal miner, was booted from the party for calling Tories *lower than vermin?*

# It's because there is a chasm not only in life experiences, but in political and economic interests between working class people and those in the professional managerial classes.

If normal working people earn more (like in Scandinavia), prices will go up by some degree, as will the median wage. This means you have a far wider middle class, great for common prosperity and poverty but bad for the bargaining power of the higher earners (PMCs) who previously enjoyed the fruits and low prices of a low wage economy.

A wider middle class via reduced inequality is an excellent thing for Britain as a country but the PMCs, Blairites, Starmerites, Tories,  you name it, all fear it because it reduces the imaginary status they've created for themselves and it **increases competition for them.** Hence the massive hysteria about Jeremy Corbyn's basic Nordic socdem platform.

Want to understand why it wasn't an urgent cost of living crisis in the media over the past two decades while young people saw hundreds of percent increases in their rents and housing costs in relation to their wages? It's because that crisis benefits the wealthiest, therefore it's not a problem.

Working class people derive their bargaining power from collective bargaining (things like unions, threat of strike action, strength in numbers), while PMCs with the free time and capital to invest in more niche skills (or to sell their souls in some cases) derive their bargaining power from there being a limited supply of those skills. This ultra-market approach is completely ok with poverty, as the market doesn't care about poverty, nor humanity, nor society.

Please can we discuss this more? I have already written too much for it to be a fun read, so please do ask questions - I'll gladly to into more depth and I'm sure other people will chime in.

**TLDR; It isn't  simply workers vs billionaires, that's largely a fantasy spread by the upper middle classes to protect their own interests and the status quo.**

928,ymq707,What is wrong with British people's attitudes to wealth?,"UPDATE: Didn't expect this to be seen by so many people! Thank you to everyone who's commented, it's been good to hear people's experiences and opinions, had some very interesting discussions in the comments. All the best to the lot of ya!

What is with British people and wealth? Just saw a post asking whether people on £150k actually have a hard time and the overwhelming response was ""rich people have problems too, they just have a different reality and it's completely valid""... 

Let's put this into context - if you earn £150k, your take home income after tax is £7k PER MONTH. Some people rightly said that over £50k of a £150k salary goes on tax, but it should be the case that the richest in society pay more. They're the only ones that can. That also still leaves you with £7k per month to take home.

Many others said the biggest problem is the companies and millionaires not paying more, and that they're the real rich people. It's right that the super wealthy are the biggest problem and something needs to be done, but still, no one seems to accept that £7k a month is plenty to live on. That's 4x the amount per month that someone on £25k sees. Pointing to bigger companies is just deflecting. 

There were even sob stories about how people on £150k or more have been hit by huge mortgage rises that they just can't afford, but if you take out a mortgage that costs the majority of £7k per month, how do people not see that as irresponsible financial planning? Whatever your salary, if your living costs take up over a certain portion of your income, you're not preparing for a change of income or harder circumstances. The difference is rich people have more room to avoid making this mistake.

Not everyone will get the opportunity to earn £150k, and rich people are incredibly quick to tell the poor to ""budget better"" and ""live within their means"", but when their income is harmed and they claim they spend most of their wealth, we're supposed to feel sorry for them. Someone said that ""people on £150k are closer to homeless people than millionaires and billionaires"", and the logic is correct, but the fact that £7k A MONTH is closer to homelessness than the richest in our society is sickening, and the idea that even that much income isn't a stable amount to live on is frankly ludicrous.

You could argue that taking out huge mortgages is within your means if £150k is your regular salary, and you could also argue that no-one could pre-empt huge interest rate or mortgage rises (and you'd at least be right about the latter). The problem with this is that it massively overlooks the idea of having a ""rainy day fund"". Again, we're always told that if we don't have a rainy day fund, no matter what we earn, we're irresponsible with our finances. The media, the government, the richest and even the poorest all adhere to this line of thinking.

There's nothing wrong with being responsible with your finances, but with the cost of rent/mortgages, transport, food and bills, most people are lucky if they put away couple of hundred pounds each month. Add children and childcare to that mix and your savings are non-existent. 

Case in point: back in 2019 I was on £20 - 21k. I could walk to work, paid moderate rent, and lived in a relatively pricey city. I do not have kids. I made a deliberate note to put away £200 a month every month to build up some savings, and in just over a year and a half, I had put away about £3.5k. That's HALF of what someone on £150k earns A MONTH. Unfortunately for me, I lost my job in the pandemic and ended up on Universal Credit. Those savings disappeared within 6 months and I fell back into an overdraft.

Did I go out for a beer with my friends every now and then? Absolutely. Could I have saved even more per month? Sure. Would it have saved me much more each month? Hardly likely (and it definitely would have made life significantly more miserable). Two years later and I have finally recovered from my financial losses. (Not a sob story, just using it as an example). 

If you're earning £7k per month and you can't amass a rainy day fun that could cover your living costs for 6 months, how are you living within your means? And why should people feel sorry for you for having more of a chance to prepare for the worst and refusing to do so?

Don't get me wrong, you should be able to have a better lifestyle with a better salary, but not seeing that those additional earnings are a significant privilege is astounding. Not recognising your misue of that privilege is not worthy of sympathy and does not ""put you in the same boat as everyone else"", and the fact that the UK at large doesn't seem to recognise the disparity between £150k and many other salaries is infuriating. It's even worse that the UK perpetually tells the poor that losing money is their fault for being ""financial irresponsible"" but rich people can fail to prepare and that's supposed to deserve sympathy.
