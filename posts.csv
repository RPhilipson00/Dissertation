The center-right 'Venstre' party (which was previously the party in government), went from 43 seats to 23 seats. New parties that split off from older parts entered the Parlament: Danish Democrats (split from the Danish People's Party) and the Moderates (split from Venstre).

But the big win is arguably for the Liberal Alliance party, a libertarian party. They went from 4 seats in the previous election to 14 seats. This is interesting, since last year in Argentina, 4 libertarian politicians were elected into their Parliament, and according to some sources, the Libertarians are now polling around 30%.

136,yfw4l5,How the federal government caused minorities in the U.S. to struggle,"As someone who is quite inquisitive in the sense where I like to learn more about different things, I wanted to learn more about why things are the way they are. Why are life circumstances the way they are for everyone right now? And after research, and time to think, I've came to the conclusion that everything we see around us, it's all by design. Have you ever wondered why drugs in the U.S. are a problem when several decades ago it wasn't?

I believe the federal governments destruction of minority communities started in the late 70s. Jimmy Carter was a radical liberal for his time. And he proposed Welfare bills and Food stamp bills for various amounts of people. For people unemployed, single parents trying to raise kids, and people just struggling. This on paper sounds fine, and granted, some people do take advantage of it, but at the time of it's inception, it was fine. But later on events only made things worse.

In the 80s, when the U.S. was trying to stop Communism from expanding, the C.I.A. was of course aiding anti-communist factions in various countries. In order to help this one gang gather enough money for weapons and supplies, the C.I.A. (under Regan) started selling crack and other drugs into American cities and towns with the gangs so they could raise money. That was a horrible mistake. The U.S. is still suffering today, and even our neighbors down south, thanks to that. The drugs ended up targeting minority communities too. And then to make things worse, Regan created the [Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1986) as a part of the War on Drugs to make the Government seem innocent when they designed the issue themselves. Then, there was the icing on the cake.

In the 90s, then Senator Joe Biden, along with President Bill Clinton started passing out excessive and ruthless crime bills targeting minorities in their respective locations, the laws went after the most stupid things too such as Marijuana, non-violent gun offenses, and so on. Many were arrested because of this. And this is when society really focused on the concept of police brutality and the police having too much power. This is when a cycle was created. People are suffering from illegal drug abuse. People get sent to brutal prisons due to that, and are took away from their families, kids, spouses.

Single mothers raising kids get put on welfare and food stamps and no longer have to work. Then kids growing up in poverty, around drugs, and with their fathers taken away and traumatized by it and then they are more likely to grow up and ""commit crime"", it's an endless cycle, rinse and repeat. Now, with all that being said, did Carter, Regan, the C.I.A., Clinton and Biden all tend for things to be this way? Did they all want minorities to struggle? I'm honestly not too sure. The main reason is because all of these bills and operations happened decades apart. But regardless, now they have all came together and caused a big problem, and left wing or right wing, it's all thanks to the federal government.

So, what can we do about this? Well, we need to ease drug and gun laws, release those for drug crimes and those who committed non-violent gun offenses. Make drugs legal, and then those making money from them illegally won't make as much if drugs are easier to obtain and legal tender.

I already (self) studied the works of Schumpeter and Böhm-Bawerk.

To keep it short - I search a good book/paper which is:

* Not older than 15 years (recent developments within ASOE should be included)
* Introduction to all relevant concepts / show the differences to mainstream economics
* Not relying on praxeology (I tried reading Mises Human Action, but was not impressed)

**\*edit:** \- I found two interesting books and one research paper:

* *Holcombe, Randall G. (2020): Advanced Introduction to the Austrian School of Economics, Edward Elgar*
* *Mayer, Thomas (2017): Austrian Economics, Money and Finance, Routledge*

If you take a large sample of houses with cats, and just opened the door and let the cats leave, some would. Some would die, some would struggle, some would thrive. Some would come back, some would go be happy to never see you again.

But you won't *LET* them leave. You are afraid that after everything you've done for the cat, the cat would just fuck off and leave. You are afraid that the dependency you projected onto the cat isn't real. That the cat does not need you, as much as you need it. You need to feel like a good person by ""taking care of"" the cat. But you never stopped to think if the cat wants or needs you to take care of it, or if it's just stuck in the system you locked it into.

And ultimately, you're afraid to find out what it would do with freedom, because you're afraid it doesn't need you. And you need, to be needed. You need to be in control over the cat, and you're terrified of losing that control. So you pretend the cat needs you, without ever giving it a choice to show that it doesn't.",4658710741871502363,1

203,ynnh4t,"In this climate of debating immigration, can we talk about children?","Let's start with some basic conservative assumptions that we rely on the growth and productivity of the workforce in order to fund our current spending/ aging population, and that the gap left by the native work force is filled by immigration so neither party wants to curtail this. Ok? Got it?

I want to move this conversation forward to talk about what I contentious issue which is the birth rate of settled, British born, middle class in this country. Why are we not having enough kids to maintain our replacement level?

Without going all nutcase replacement theory, there are certain groups that will have multiple children; but the more educated, career focused and wealthier households are the less children we will have. And that needs to change if we actually want to get a hold on immigration.


As a young woman, Tory, but also ambitious individual, I don't think we should blame educated women as the demons here- I would love to have multiple children, but I've narrowed it down to three factors that make it less desirable for me, university educated, has a decent job and stable relationship to consider having more than 2 children, compared to a immigrant or working class population where the mother (or both parties) doesn't work. (I'm an immigrant myself but a very middle class one with two highly skilled professional parents) 


1/ The obvious: prohibitive cost of childcare vs career progression: women who don't want to take a massive career break at a time in their lives where big promotions and officerships takes place. Having multiple children in succession would be career suicide, but if you're on the cusp of the free childcare bracket then all your allowance gets taken away and you get burnt both ends. People on lower salaries or in communities where women are expected to stop working after children don't experience this squeeze as much as they break even if they don't work vs. sacrificing a much higher salary.


2/Average quality of schooling in this country is awful, so either you have to plan and see how many children you can afford to privately educate, or the cost of buying a family home in a decent grammar/comprehensive catchment area. My education as an only child in a relatively LCOL city in this country cost my parents £100,000+ over my adolescence. London schools are more expensive, London postcodes even more so. Very little is being done to improve the quality of primary and secondary education in this country and instead we are seeing lots of academy/ faith school/ schools where there's basically only single demographic pupils due to the socio economics of the area. 


3/ House prices factor in/almost necessitate having double income households... So say you've done all the right things to counteract the above, paid for your 'good comprehensive school catchment' postcode, found a place with decent nurseries nearby, overmortgaged yourself with your partner, salary sacrificed to keep your childcare allowance... Will you ever be able to take time off to spend with your babies in their earliest years? If you have a slightly more complicated pregnancy, a child with special needs etc. There's a choice that will have to be made about returning to the workforce or a parent taking a pay cut. 



One of my ideas to solve to this would be cut child benefits to remove the incentive to 'just have children' and replace it with free childcare for all. This encourages more people who participate in the workforce to have children without sacrificing work. I've been informed by my boyfriend that this would be an instant vote loser on par with Liz Truss, but I'm trying to think long-term here.

242,yjmx84,Have the tories deliberately underfunded the NHS,"I work in the NHS.

I hear a lot of talk from my colleagues as well as the public as to how the Tories have deliberately underfunded the NHS in order to expand privatisation and eventually get rid of healthcare that is free at the point of delivery.

Wait times in the NHS from primary care to secondary cafe are currently abysmal for anything that is not a 2 week wait. I myself have experienced ordering urgent scans for patients to be done within the next 4 weeks only to be told that the wait is 3 months minimum (this was last year). Now I’m told by colleague such a scan would take a year. Patients are waiting hours (10+) to be seen in A&E. 2 ww targets for cancer are being missed.

I wasn’t working in the noughties but I am told that the NHS ran much better then, staff were well paid with higher morale and so retention was better, wait times were lower etc but since austerity everything has gone down hill.

Now I have never voted conservative, and I am not a labour voter either. I am not a die hard NHS fan but neither am I completely against it. I just want a health service that works.

I am aware there are some in Tory circles who would like to be rid of the NHS. But I struggle to believe that the current state of the NHS is due to deliberate underfunding because why would anyone do that surely? I know COVID has exacerbated things but things weren’t that great in 2019 either. 

Would we be in a similar state now had Labour been in charge during the 2010s or has all of this been a part of the big bad Tories?

EDIT:

My gut suspicion is that this situation is due to poor retention of staff, necessary austerity given the public finances in 2010 were honestly terrible (as opposed to cutting services for the hell of it) and the realities of an ageing population. And the fact that the NHS may not have the best funding model for our current populations needs.",-4635687493878771918,1

**This was supposed to be the week we got the government’s fiscal plan.**

But with the arrival of a new prime minister, Jeremy Hunt’s financial package has been delayed until 17 November. Expect big cuts and tax rises. The figure being talked about is £50 billion.

**Instead, there’s plenty of lawmaking to be done.**

One government bill making its Commons debut would create a publicly-owned infrastructure bank to invest in projects that tackle the climate emergency or address regional inequality.

**And reshuffles have created a number of select committee chair vacancies.**

Health, Treasury, Education, and Transport are all up for grabs. Select committee chair positions are divided between the parties, and all four of these have to be Tories.

So far, Steve Brine and Anne Marie Morris have been nominated for health, and John Baron and Harriett Baldwin for Treasury.

### MONDAY 31 OCTOBER

**Genetic Technology (Precision Breeding) Bill - report stage and 3rd reading**  
Allows the sale of gene-edited food. Potential mooted uses are to crops more drought-resilient or resistant to diseases. Gene editing differs from genetically modifying in that it's a small, controlled tweak to a living organism’s existing DNA rather than the introduction of a new, foreign gene. Both are de-facto banned in the EU so this is a major post-Brexit divergence from EU law.

**Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill - consideration of Lords amendments**  
Introduces regulation to make smart devices (like smart TVs and speakers) more secure against cyber attacks. Aims to speed up the rollout of mobile, full-fibre and gigabit-capable networks across the UK.

### TUESDAY 1 NOVEMBER

**Internet Access (Children Eligible for Free School Meals) Bill**  
Requires the government to ensure that all children eligible for free school meals have a broadband connection and facilities to access the internet at home. Ten minute rule motion presented by Siobhain McDonagh.

**UK Infrastructure Bank Bill - 2nd reading**  
Completes the setup of the UK Infrastructure Bank, a state-owned but operationally independent bank that invests in projects to tackle climate change and support regional economic growth. Gives the bank the power to lend directly to local authorities and the Northern Ireland Executive. Started in the Lords.

### WEDNESDAY 2 NOVEMBER

**Microplastic Filters (Washing Machines) Bill**  
Requires manufacturers to fit microplastic-catching filters to new domestic and commercial washing machines, among other things. Ten minute rule motion presented by Alberto Costa.

2 seats are up for election for Michigan supreme court, the two conservatives of the bunch are: 

**Brian Zahra** -currently sitting on the court. During his tenure so far on the state supreme court, he has ruled and dissented conservatively on the issue of abortion and same-sex unions. 

**Paul Hudson** is currently an appellate lawyer in private practice. He has a judicial philosophy that a judge judges and that judge do not create public policy. 

##**Ballot Proposals**

######Prop 3 

**Vote no** - This codifies abortion, even without parental consent, for reasons stretching as far as ""mental health"". 

######Proposal 2

**Vote no** - allowing for ID free voting, and allows for in person voting before election day.

######Proposal 1

**Vote no** - prop would increases term limits to 12 years in each the house and the senate, compared to 12 years total, and mandates any state political official to release their financial information.

So while no boot would be great. And not voting may seem to make a statement. If the bootlickers all vote for the heavy boot, then YOU will still be living with the heavy boot.

So you can tell yourself you didn’t participate and you’re a rebel. But you will still be under their thumb. 

Or you could choice the lesser of 2 evils and try and work with what you have to move them more towards an An-Cap position over time. Because An-Cap isn’t going to happen overnight. It is not some magical land that will just appear. Live with reality.

What does that mean for you?

512,yngpcv,Terrible subs and channels that are deeply brainwashing people with far-left urban propaganda,"Subs like fuckcars and YouTube channels like Not Just Bikes are advocating for the “live in the pods eat the bugs” way of life.

Modern urbanists along with far-left fanatics want to take away your car and force you to live in high-density residential buildings just like how people used to live in the USSR.

It’s easier to control people when they depend on government-owned public transportation and when they’re all crammed in dense overpopulated cities.

The fact that this anti-car urban movement, that is especially indoctrinating vulnerable young people, is gaining traction, is concerning. A dangerous poison for our freedom and independence. 

This has to be a conspiracy. No wonder the algorithms are pushing for pro-urban crap YouTube videos to influence people into thinking that forced collectivization where people no longer own anything and have to share everything is supposedly a good thing.

You don’t get to own a private yard with a pool anymore. You have to use the public pools that are filled with perverts. Want to enjoy privacy outdoors? Your only option is communal spaces or public parks where you find thugs and pedophiles.

With Great Power we will denounce, oppose, criticize and destroy the new urbanism cult that is infesting the whole internet with propaganda that attempts to destroy our precious quality of life.

I see the role of the president of the United States of America as the most difficult job on the planet (we can discuss that, but I think that's the reality), and the issue with that is the fact that establishments want that role to be controlled by someone that they themselves can control. I am definetly and utterly disgusted by the fact that elections are guided on a direction that's not really decided by the population, and I think that Trump being elected before Biden was a glitch. A crack in the castle of glass, a blow of fresh breeze on the castle of cards that the industry established in the past decades. Voting for Trump is not just voting for Trump, the reality is that voting for him is equivalent to fighting a propaganda machine that is trying to destroy everything in regards to the freedom of any individual.This is much bigger than what folks can understand. Trump is the last attempt that people have at their disposal to make a difference. For all the people that can do something about it, and when elections will come, I beg you, do whatever is in your power to try and make others aware of what the world situation is.
Everytime the human race was in a situation of great peril, it all started with a few individuals that were able to advocate for the truth, that were able to make the masses open their eyes on what were the possible scenarios that the world was going towards.
Please, everyone, don't force your vision on others, just challenge their beliefs, understand that 99% of the world is under a spell called propaganda, understand that the minds of the public are brainwashed and instead of going to war against them, challenge their point of views and guide them on a more educated choice.
Constant conflicts between us will never serve a purpose.
We need to fight against the game, not the players.
Use facts against bullshit and kindness against hatred. I myself try continuously to persuade others from going down the rabbit hole that big tech, big pharma, and the industries are trying to guide the folks mind into, and other than that I can't do much more. 
But for everyone that lives in the US and knows other people there, you can make a BIG difference on the results of the next election.
Do a little bit of research, keep some material at hand, ready to demonstrate whatever your point is. Try to see the matter as a help that you give others to understand what's going on, and not a battle between races, political views and all that other bullshit that they want you to be polarized to.

TLDR Just voting is not enough. Do it, preferably in person, and help others to get to an educated decision. Not trying to be dramatic but I think that the entire world depends on the next USA elections",789004940223475575,1

600,xwazhg,Let's analyze the situation in Europe now that Nordstream 2 is gone for the foreseeable future,"We've had [discussions of the Ukraine war and its broader implications at the outset of the war](https://old.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/t4du3r/america_defeats_germany_for_the_third_time_in_a/hyxv4vw/). Now that the Nordstream 2 pipeline has been sabotaged and it is not clear when or even if it can be repaired the situation has accelerated and changed. It is worthwhile and I would say pressing to come to a clear understanding of what this means. So I'm giving my analysis not as some definitive word but just to have some perspective and to get a discussion going.

First people of course want to know who was behind the sabotage. The European and American imperialists were quick at the draw with an answer: the Russians, and don't you dare suggest it was the US. In the grander scheme of things what is important is the dynamics this can unfold in Europe and indeed globally. But we can at least look at the two main suspects and reason through the qui bono. Before that some context. The pipeline was not just a Russian project, it was primarily a joint project of Russia and Germany with other Europeans both involved and opposed. It was a crucial project for German imperialism to ensure not just constant and cheap energy supply, but to forge a deeper and lasting alliance with Russia. The Eastern Europeans, Ukraine in particular, were opposed to the pipeline because by circumventing these countries they would lose transfer costs they still receive otherwise - for Germany in turn this would have meant even lower energy costs. So this was not simply an attack on Russian infrastructure, it was an attack on German imperialism and Europe at large as it substantially undermines its energy security, thus its independence from the US and the prosperity of its industries.

The reasoning produced by bourgeois media regarding Russia's motivation goes as follows: The Russians have leverage over Europe by means of their supply of resources. They want to use this leverage, but not openly so. Thus they sabotaged their own pipeline to put pressure on Europe, and they blame the US to split the Euro-American alliance. The problem with the reasoning is evident: by blowing up the pipelines the Russians would have blown up their own leverage, not used it, but negated it while also losing customers who are only becoming more desperate for their resources in spite of all the posturing. But even the motivation is questionable, since the West is already in open war with Russia, they are openly supplying arms and funds to Ukraine and [buying out the entire country for decades to come](https://thenextrecession.wordpress.com/2022/08/13/ukraine-the-invasion-of-capital/). Why would the Russians not simply turn off the pipelines openly, or do so again with a thinly veiled pretense as they did with Nordstream 1 so that everyone understands the message, rather than actually blowing it up and destroying their leverage.

The US on the other hand has been rallying against the construction of the pipeline  ever since its was conceived. Why? Because it works towards the creation of one of their biggest geostrategic nightmares, the alliance of Russian resources and German capital and industry which creates a genuine threat to US imperialism. We've all seen the [clips of Biden](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FVbEoZXhCrM) and [Nuland openly announcing that they will find a way to shut down the pipeline](https://detv.us/2022/01/28/victoria-nuland-threatens-to-shut-down-nord-stream-2-if-russia-invades-ukraine-rt-en/) from earlier this year, but the background to these threats are much deeper. NATO itself has as one of its main functions the purpose of [keeping Germany and Russia at arms length](https://www.counterfire.org/articles/history/18584-keep-the-russians-out-the-americans-in-and-the-germans-down-a-potted-and-bloody-history-of-nato). And precisely this was being undermined by the existence of the pipeline, at a time when German industry has already conquered Europe and while the US is in rapid decline. Now that the pipeline is destroyed, so is this danger gone for the immediate future.

This leads me to the larger point. I think to make sense of this whole war we have to be conscious that the US has been preparing for the war against China for almost two decades by now. This is what necessitates the radicalism of US foreign policy. With [Obama's strategic Pivot to Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian_foreign_policy_of_the_Barack_Obama_administration) a new phase in this preparation was started, now the coming conflict informs every move of the US bourgeoisie and their political agents. Prior to the pipeline sabotage I thought the main goal was to lure Russia into the conflict, which ought to internally destabilize it and depose Putin, opening the way for a US comprador who could then [dismantle Russia into a number of helpless small nations](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/russia-putin-colonization-ukraine-chechnya/639428/). Now I'm starting to think the primary target was actually Europe, particularly Germany, not Russia (which remains the a secondary goal).

For some time now there have been efforts to bring industry back to the US. Recently there is [the program of repatriating chip production to the US](https://mronline.org/2022/08/09/u-s-china-chip-war-continues/), but to goal has to be larger in order to prepare for the large scale confrontation with China. And that's where the sabotage of Nordstream 2 pipeline does wonders for the US. It creates a renewed dependence of another imperialist block that was becoming increasingly alienated from the US ever since the creation of the EU. At the same time it destroys the industries of Europe, who now will no longer have the necessary resources to continue production. Even if they change to American natural gas the price will be 7 to 8 fold than that of Russian gas, which would raise the cost of production to a level that might simply be no longer competitive. Indeed [industries have already started](https://www-handelsblatt-com.translate.goog/technik/it-internet/wirtschaftspolitik-deutsche-unternehmen-bauen-ihre-standorte-in-den-usa-immer-weiter-aus-/28697464.html?nlayer=Technologie-News_3684670&_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=de&_x_tr_pto=wapp) moving [from Europe to the US](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/09/europe-faces-an-exodus-of-energy-intensive-industries.html). *So the destruction of European industry works directly in favor of re-industrialization of the US.* [Michael Hudson reckons that Europe has effectively lost an entire decade of development](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/09/michael-hudson-on-the-euro-without-germany.html) due to the destruction of the pipelines. And now that Europe will no longer be competitive nor independent of the US it also is of less use for China, as its living standards falls and thus its potential purpose as a market for complex products will dwindle. Seemingly a success for the US all along the line.

This, btw. was one of the horror visions of Engels. In a letter to Sorge from January 7, 1888 while thinking through a potential world war he considered the option of Europe becoming entwined in a prolonged internal conflict that would lead to US industry overtaking it. In that case Engels saw two options: either Europe would de-industrialize as it would no longer be competitive with US industry and thus become one of the domains of US imperialism, or it would overthrow its bourgeoisie and finally enter into socialist transition. This just as an interesting detail.

To the consequences for the coming development. Europe will fall into a deep and prolonged economic and social crisis. This, of course, heightens the trends towards fascization, likely to a critical degree. The fascists will use the crisis to argue to move away from the US and towards the east (thus isolating the US), they will use it to discredit not just the established bourgeois faction who created this crisis in the first place with its obedience to US dictates, they will use it to discredit bourgeois democracy in its entirety. Certainly a section of the established, US aligned political caste will switch tone and abandon the US. [Merkel, who was one of the last intelligent imperialist politicians of some actual stature, already remarked](https://www.german-foreign-policy.com/news/detail/9040) that Germany shouldn't just give up on Nordstream 2 (it still doesn't seem to be clear if it can be repaired after all). It remains to be seen just how strong bourgeois democracy is in Europe, I would not rule out that it can survive this crisis by coming this close to fascism without actually tipping into it. The other trend that will emerge, I think, is an actual revolutionary left. With the deep and broad impoverishment that this crisis will bring the conditions for such an actual left are finally recreated and much faster than would have happened otherwise. In this sense this terrorist attack by the US on Europe (by US I'm including its proxies, who may have done it for them, [say Poland for example](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/09/the-bornholm-blow-up-repeats-the-bornholm-bash-poland-attacks-germany-and-blames-russia.html)) could well turn out to be a godsend by the American bourgeoisie to the world proletariat. These are the struggles that the left in Europe has to prepare for. They have to make concrete studies of how these tendencies will work themselves out within the context of their given society, how they can affect them in favor of overcoming the bourgeois order.

I know this already got too long for a forum post, but it deserves still much more detailed analysis (I'm cutting it short intentionally so that someone will still read it at all, also because I don't have too much time). Hopefully we can work towards something like it in a discussion. I'm totally open to reasoned disagreements.

E: Almost forgot that I wanted to tag u/TheRedMarxist in this.

E2: Update: [according to fascist German politicians](https://twitter.com/Alice_Weidel/status/1577960036613201920?cxt=HHwWgIC9wd-SheYrAAAA) there's still a functional line of Nordstream 2 and the Russians have offered to supply gas through it. German media aligned with the government coalition (which is close to the entire media) has not reported on this. But this will turn out to be a significant bit of leverage by the German fascists which they can use to push their agenda. [There's already been demonstrations in Germany](https://www-jungewelt-de.translate.goog/artikel/435564.gegen-hohe-energiepreise-wut-in-ostdeutschland.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=de&_x_tr_pto=wapp) with people demanding the government to drop the sanctions on Russia and open Nordstream 2, demonstrations largely lead by fascist forces.

I've also added some more links in case people want to get a more concrete picture (which I'd recommend, of course).

E3: [New source on the still working Nordstream 2 line and the Russian offer](https://www.dw.com/en/putin-offers-europe-gas-through-nord-stream-2-germany-declines/a-63416138 ) (already denied by the Germans, but we'll see as the social pressure mounts). Also mentions that it will take at least one year to repair the pipelines. This is not that long, but I'm not sure how it will influence Russia's actions in the war, if they prolong it with that in sight, speculating that Germans will change course, or if its too long for them. Putin's following suggestion might point to the former option:

> ""We could move the lost volumes from the Nord Streams along the bottom of the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea region and thus make the main routes for the supply of our fuel, our natural gas to Europe through Turkey, creating the largest gas hub for Europe in Turkey,"" 

This has to be read as another offer to Germany in particular, as German capital and politics is intimately entwined with Turkey's comprador bourgeoisie. Ukraine has already suggested destroying the existing Russian pipeline running through Turkey, and there was already one such attempt. I think Russia also doesn't want to fall completely into dependency on China, with the potential of simply becoming its resource colony. By keeping the European connection alive it also maintains political and economic room for maneuverability.

There was also another sabotage attack in Germany, this time on the public transport system. [Here's an analysis](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/10/whose-cat-caught-the-german-tongue-no-blame-for-russia-after-german-train-sabotage-on-sunday-morning-no-blame-for-nord-stream-sabotage-yet.html) which points out two things: (1) German politics is shy on putting the blame for this on Russia so far, and (2) the growing tensions and shifts within the government and German political landscape at large.

And [there was yet another damaged pipeline](https://www.dw.com/en/poland-reports-leak-in-oil-pipeline-to-germany/a-63410763), a Russian crude oil one running through Poland to supply Europe in general and Germany in particular. AfD, the German fascist party, already put the accident in doubt, suggesting it was sabotage. They're probably right, I'd wager, as Poland is the strongest partner of the US in mainland Europe and has obvious historical reasons to hate German imperialism. Poles are suggesting it was once again the Russians sabotaging their own pipeline, naturally.

Finally [this is a bit of a longer piece on the deep economic and social effects of the crises](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/10/protests-are-growing-across-europe-as-inflation-surges-and-economic-crisis-deepens.html), both regarding the energy supply and the inflation. Particularly interesting regarding France and Germany. If you've heard about the gas protests in France, this is some good background to check out.

> Not only is inflation raging but economic activity is grinding to a standstill. Legions of small and medium sized businesses, still shouldering heavy debts after the lockdowns of 2020, are facing an existential crisis.

> [...] **Of greatest concern is the Euro Area’s largest economy, Germany, whose industrial backbone is massively dependent on cheap sources of abundant energy, which no longer exist thanks to the recent rupturing of Nordstream I and II.**

Global Times has an opinion piece on the growing tendencies towards a turn away from the US along with the danger of falling completely under its hegemony (they probably correctly aleardy give up on the UK in this regard). It's called *Europe awakes to US sabotage of its autonomy* and includes this remarkable piece of information:

> In the first eight months of this year, European companies' investment in China surged by 123.7 percent. Many European manufacturing giants continue to bet part of their future on cooperation with China, and they are expressing their attitude toward Europe's China policy with their actions.",-275544864150723469,0

As I was looking at a chart on life expectancy in Russia from the mid 1800's's up to modern times (https://www.statista.com/statistics/1041395/life-expectancy-russia-all-time/), I noticed a certain period that I'm curious about. 

One can obviously observe an increasing trend with hiccups along the way that led to the trends slowing down or decreasing temporarily, e.g. the Russian civil war, WW2, etc. After WW2, yet after these, one can observe a very accelerated and significant increase in life expectancy, yet it's then faced with a very abrupt halt between the late 50's, early 60's, followed by a significant decrease in life expectancy after Gorbachev's introduction of neoliberal reforms into the nation, followed by an increase again after many years. And from there, whe're at current times.

But what was exactly happening in the 50's-60's that led to that initial halt? Was there a major change or a chain of events that signified this stop, or was this trend more of a reflection on the limitations of the medicinal sciences of the times?",9173520086296325292,0

afaik The Philippines is the most advanced site of revolutionary struggle. Communists are popular and active in Sudan. The same is being built in Kenya. Latin America is tricky because of it's proximity to the US and saturation with US military bases, however there is a very high level of class consciousness, and the shining resilience of Cuba that many movements aspire to.

Since Capital is a ""critique of political economy"" I'm wondering to what extent it's worth reading the major works of Smith and Ricardo in order to fully understand Capital. As dialectical materialists, we recognize that our philosophy is necessary to present an accurate reflection of material reality, so I am a bit hesitant to tell myself that it is necessary to read the major political economists that preceded Marx in order to understand capitalism; as an expression of dialectical materialism, I expect that Capital itself is adequate to get at the essence of it. On the other hand, if Capital is intended as a critique of political economy, I feel that I should understand the content that Marx is critiquing. Moreover, I wonder if there is much in the major works of Smith and Ricardo that isn't touched on by Marx, since it had already been developed previously? Would love some context.

648,ybi14c,Questions for Chinese People,"I am currently in China and will be spending some time here making some observations for personal research. Please leave in the comments any questions you would like me to ask Chinese people. Certain questions involving deep knowledge of theory (e.g. what do you think of Trotsky) I will try to ask officials and professors who should theoretically be able to answer. Other questions that do not involve anything complex (what do you think of this controversy reported in Western media?) I will ask normal people. Please do not ask me for personal information. I will not answer.

After spending a bit of time here, my initial impression is that China is indeed a ""third world country"" in every sense of the word. The g7 are put on a pedestal. White people from the G7 are treated like celebrities to varying degrees. The ""rise of xenophobia"" BS you see on the internet is nonsense. Living conditions are similar to other poor countries, the big exceptions are infrastructure and safety, which are better than most countries.

There is immense confusion as regards Marxist theory. I visited a university. The professors are split between bourgeois theory (which is euphemistically referred to as mainstream theory) and Marxist theory (most seem to be supporting the former). Those supporting the former are obviously anti-communists, but for obvious reasons do not directly speak out against the government. I assume that politically they are a mix between ""reformers"" and counter-revolutionaries.

The Marxists (professional academic ones) are eclectic. Karl Marx once said, ""The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e. the class which is the ruling material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectual force."" The leading material and therefore intellectual force today globally is undoubtedly the American bourgeoisie. Universities all around the world (including China) use American textbooks in the social science curriculums. This is already a bit shocking for those who don't know better. What genuinely shocked me was to find Marxists agreeing with and promoting David Harvey, Paul Sweezy, and Modern Monetary Theory (this last one does not even pretend to be Marxist)! I used to think Western Marxism was only of interest to petite-bourgeois academics in the West. I was wrong.

The countries targeted by the G7 in today's world often have reactionary political/economic systems. This leads to confusion among the left (e.g. what should the left's stance be toward the Syrian government?). The confusion stems from the fact that the country's position may be progressive from the standpoint of the global economic system, but the same country can have regressive domestic policies. There is even more confusion regarding China since it is ruled by the CPC.  To be fair, the Chinese people themselves are also confused. Chinese students are confused as to why, despite the fact that their country's official ideology is Marxism-Leninism, anti-Marxist theories are predominant in universities. Knowledge of contemporary imperialism (either in the liberal sense of military aggression or the Leninist sense) is almost non-existent among ordinary people and even party officials. I once met a CPC member who works in government who had never read the Communist Manifesto ( this member had time to study abroad in England however!) Despite this, Xi Jinping in one of his recent journal articles wrote something along the lines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin did not expect that we would have to manage a socialist market...We are still revolutionaries and must uphold our revolutionary tradition. Propaganda that supports socialism is also everywhere. Occasionally I even hear on the street a siren reminding people to remember socialist values.

Unfortunately, it has been my experience that anybody critical towards the CPC leans towards liberalism. Many of these people are confused as opposed to being genuine reactionaries. When I start explaining basic Marxist concepts to them, they are instantly fully supportive (in contradistinction to many Westerners who are taught to despise communism).

Finally, I will say that our situation objectively right now is not great. Since the fall of the USSR (arguably since the late 1950s), the global left has been theoretically confused and pessimistic about the future. China is not an exception to this rule. It is my hope that the young generation can make the final push towards human liberation. Anyone who has anything positive to say about developments in other countries please leave it in the comments.

I am writing a paper for class comparing and contrasting the characteristics of the 1936 Arab Uprising in Palestine and the recent 2021 general strike in response to Israeli brutal aggression in Gaza. If you didn't know, this was the first time in almost 100 years that geographically separated Palestinians mass participated in a general strike together. It cost the Israeli economy 30 million in damages and revealed the occupation's dependence on Palestinian workers who are often paid in shit wages, bad working conditions, humiliating border-crossing, etc.

&#x200B;

I'm writing this essay to demonstrate that while most foreign actors or states attempt to reduce the occupation to a religious issue, that it is also a class-based issue on top of a colonial one, feminist one, imperialist one, etc.  I aim to write specifically about the class part.

&#x200B;

I'm looking for any accounts or articles about the 2021 strikes (can be in other languages) or academic articles exploring the link between Israel's capitalist expansion and the exploitation of Palestinian workers.

655,y9epgr,My argument against electoralism/voting,"My case against electoralism/voting.

I've seen a rise in electoralism in leftist spaces in recent times, I think no doubt to people like Contra et al, but I'd like to state a few reasons for why the whole electoral game is bankrupt due to scale and inherent contradictions.



1. It requires enormous energy and investment to win.

Voting isn't simply about the individual votes, on the scale of a national or regional election you're talking thousands if not millions of votes. That's why parties instead focus more on the voting blocks to garner support. For this you need a lot of time and money and labour to succeed and get your candidate in the running. In other words you need a very well organised and costly campaign that may not necessarily succeed.

Socialists should not be looking towards entering this system that is very susceptible to corruption, opportunism, and inefficiencies over time. Rather invest their labour and money in other direct action ventures that can challenge the system and maybe by a secondary measure influence electoral politics. The ultimate truth of electoralism is 'If you don't CAMPAIGN, you can't COMPLAIN' because in order for the candidate to get ANYWHERE there needs to be lots of funding and organising behind it to get a mass group of people voting for you. And for that, it requires you engage in that campaign to make it work, not JUST VOTE.



2. Social change comes from the societal conditions first and foremost.

People often state that the more left wing candidate will be able to be more effective when it comes to workers rights and change. Yet as we can see throughout history this was more due to the circumstances involved. The New Deal came in response to the crashed economy, the post war reforms in the UK were held by both parties, there was far greater organised labour to bargain, and many repressed groups were also fighting for their say in the nation's affairs.

The rise of Reagan and Thatcher was a response to the downturn in the economy and a need for reshuffling in order to sustain profiteering into the future.  

It’s not to say that history is deterministic, but that the change doesn’t occur at electorate level, it's always driven by much larger factors. Gay marriage, The renters reform bill, and even ACORN UK all came about, or were funded  by initiatives from… a tory government. And now it appears like they're on the way out.

3. The goals and aims of the left are not the same as the right.

The right-wings gains from electoralism are always used as a reason for why the left should engage more with electoral politics and win elections, if they can do it, so should we.

Ignoring what I said in part 1, or that we don't have as much money, lets also remember that the instrument that sustains the system, will not be very effective as a means to destroy it. The right can always lean on the status quo ante and bolster it, the left on the other hand has the much harder job of destroying the very roots of that system. Part of why the left is so divided is because everyone has different ideas about how to go about this and what society should look like, the right already has the foundations of that set firmly, it just needs to retreat to them, hence they tend to get along without too many arguments.

4. It creates opportunism and stagnation.

People might think that a more left centre politician might create a greater avenue for making change, however often the electoral game simply co-opts and recuperates these issues.

Roe vs Wade being overturned for example allows the perfect opportunity for Democrats to bring people into the political game and give themselves a career boost. In other words, the injustice becomes an opportunity, in the same way that many charities depend upon the problems they intend to solve in order to exist.

Similarly, having a strong Conservative party allows the Scottish National Party to scapegoat their problems onto them. If Scotland were independent that would be much harder to do. I'm not saying that's the reason they don't attempt an independence referendum again, but its understandable to see why they wouldn't attempt to remove all doubt, especially when you notice what happened to the Liberal Democrats when they shared power.

It's easy to see why if a left-wing politician were to gain power that the situation would simply become a matter of them sustaining power whilst implementing small reforms here and there, whilst beating off more radical groups and energies that wish to go further.



5. It destroys the focus on the left from radical aims into a door-to-door canvasing endeavour.

I'll just let Libcom explain this better than I can.

 Every criticism of 'abolish the family' as a slogan imagines the socialist as stranger, no connection to their listener who has little/no prior knowledge and disengages when they hear something they don't like (rather than ask Qs): this is the doorstep socialism of electoralism 

 Might these be conversations with friends/workmates? Long term relationships where people say ""well, they might be a mad bastard but not all wrong""? No, just ""what would they say if I knocked the door and said 'I'm campaigning for X; how do you feel about abolishing the family'?"" 

 This is politics imagined as an elevator pitch: if you don't immediately say what the stranger wants to hear, they'll close the door on you. If that's your politics, ok; but that's not the end of socialist ideas (let alone activity!) 

 Point is, if you have radical politics, you're always gonna be a bit of an outlier. But the point of socialism/communism/whatever politics is to build relationships & your non-politico mates/workmates (fuck, even your fellow activists!) don't have to swallow your worldview whole   



6. It's not as simple as 'Do both'

The argument that 'WE CAN DO BOTH' is complicated by the fact that its always weighted on the reformist side.

A line has emerged in recent times - ""Do radical actions WHEN they come about, Do reform IN THE MEANTIME"" which is probably one of the more impoverished statements I've ever heard.

If we actually want to move things forward we have to create the circumstances for those radical actions, and perhaps do reform as a side activity if it is clear and convenient (referendums). So the statement should be ""Do reform WHEN things come about, Do Radical Actions IN THE MEAN TIME!""


What I will say though is that voter apathy only works if that apathy is being funnelled into a different channel, Not voting alone doesn't change the system either. So other avenues need to be created in order for that to work. The problem is people simply insist ""Oh we don't have those yet"" which becomes a self-fulfilling philosophy that basically amounts to ""We won't ever have them"" because such people are not interested in developing the bases in the first place... because they don't exist.",-631771007424558410,0

Basically the pact was offered by the Nazis for the USSR to become a fourth axis power and be allowed a sphere of influence from the Middle East to India and Asia. It was turned down outright and Molotov spent a couple of days in Berlin negotiating and ultimately the Germans didn’t accept the counter offer of the USSR maintaining influence in Europe and at the end refused to respond to the USSR despite being asked several times. Throughout Soviet times the common narrative was that Stalin was testing the Germans and there was a publication that’s said to have been edited by Stalin himself saying as much until 1991.

Broken promises regarding NATO's expansion eastward, and seeking to confine Russia geopolitically to the point where they strangle them.

All this imperialism narrative serves to do is to make Putin (who is no doubt an oligarch and thug) into a cartoon Hitler 2.0 and absolve the West of complicity in their antagonism. NATO  has been training Ukrainian troops by the thousands since 2014. Ukraine has permitted fascists to march on their streets, supported by local officials. They have attacked civilians in the Donbass. Yet, now they are the darlings of the west.

> But while the bourgeoisie chooses the path of war, the working class in the capitalist countries, brought to despair by four years of crisis and unemployment, is beginning to take the path of revolution. This means that a revolutionary crisis is maturing and will continue to mature. And the more the bourgeoisie becomes entangled in its war schemes, the more frequently it resorts to terrorist methods of fighting against the working class and the labouring peasantry, the more rapidly will the revolutionary crisis develop.

> Some comrades think that, once there is a revolutionary crisis, the bourgeoisie is bound to get into a hopeless position, that its end is therefore a foregone conclusion, that the victory of the revolution is thus assured, and that all they have to do is to wait for the fall of the bourgeoisie and to draw up victorious resolutions. That is a profound mistake. The victory of the revolution never comes of itself. It must be prepared for and won. And only a strong proletarian revolutionary party can prepare for and win victory. Moments occur when the situation is revolutionary, when the rule of the bourgeoisie is shaken to its very foundations, and yet the victory of the revolution does not come, because there is no revolutionary party of the proletariat with sufficient strength and prestige to lead the masses and to take power. It would be unwise to believe that such ""cases"" cannot occur.

> It is worth while in this connection to recall Lenin's prophetic words on revolutionary crisis, uttered at the Second Congress of the Communist International:

> > ""We have now come to the question of the revolutionary crisis as the basis of our revolutionary action. And here we must first of all note two widespread errors. On the one hand, the bourgeois economists depict this crisis as mere ‘unrest,' as the English so elegantly express it. On the other hand, revolutionaries sometimes try to prove that the crisis is absolutely hopeless. That is a mistake. There is no such thing as an absolutely hopeless situation. The bourgeoisie behaves like an arrogant plunderer who has lost his head; it commits folly after folly, making the situation more acute and hastening its own doom. All this is true. But it cannot be ‘proved' that there is absolutely no chance of its gulling some minority of the exploited with some kind of minor concessions, or of suppressing some movement or uprising of some section or another of the oppressed and exploited. To try to ‘prove' beforehand that a situation is ‘absolutely' hopeless would be sheer pedantry, or juggling with concepts and catchwords. In this and similar questions the only real ‘proof' is practice. The bourgeois system all over the world is experiencing a most profound revolutionary crisis. The revolutionary parties must now ‘prove' by their practical actions that they are sufficiently intelligent and organised, are sufficiently in contact with the exploited masses, are sufficiently determined and skilful, to utilise this crisis for a successful and victorious revolution"" (Lenin, Vol. XXV, pp. 340-41).

I thought it could be worthwhile bringing this up again because there's a certain fatalism about this new structural crisis of the capitalist world system taking a hold among the left, I get the impression. Faced with the lack of any substantially organized revolutionary left in the imperialist countries some seek refuge in the illusion that capitalism will just collapse on its own. Theories of capitalism's final collapse like Luxemburg's and Grossmann's are becoming more popular among intellectuals, which I'd say is an expression of this weakness, where the theory then serves as a means to alleviate the pain of this terrible situation or actually mystify it into a strength. In this sense it is worth pointing out that both Luxemburg and Grossmann also understood their theories not as arguments for fatalism, but as arguments for why the working class has to become organized and prevent this final collapse, which would hurt the oppressed and exploited people the most.",-275544864150723469,0

I'd recommend reading [Why Socialism](https://speakoutsocialists.org/wp-content/uploads/Einstein-Why-Socialism-web.pdf); an article by Albert Einstein. This article is more on our modern Society answering why we humans accept socialism and how it is inevitable. 

Socialism is the idea and concept of the workers owning the mean of production, distribution, and exchange. It is the most common definition but I’m taking the Marxist definition. The necessary step to communism, and bringing the workers' power to the top. I would be avoiding the definitions from some people being that being [Social Democracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lDZaKjfs4E) is the same as socialism.

Let's first check socialism and capitalism and compare both. The USA is known as the icon of capitalism, and the USSR (1922–1991) is the icon of socialism. Let us check the US literacy rate. 79% is the literacy rate of the US in 2022. The USSR? About 100% by the 1950s. That is success in education. Point 1: socialism

Sources: [Liebowitz, Ronald (1986). Education and Literacy Data in Russian and Soviet Censuses](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctt1g69xfv.13), 

Now, let us check healthcare and healthcare affordability. In the USA, the average ambulance is 1200 USD (not including insurance; when included, it is 450 USD), and 56% of the nation cannot pay for 1000 USD in medical emergencies, let alone an ambulance ride. 265 dollars for just talking to the doctor. The USSR? Healthcare was free, and all Soviet citizens were happy. Point 2: socialism

Sources: [US cost of ambulances](https://www.talktomira.com/post/how-much-does-an-ambulance-ride-cost-without-insurance#:~:text=Bottom%20Line,the%20type%20of%20supplies%20used.), [CNN article about 56% of all US citizens cannot afford a 1000$ emergency](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/19/56percent-of-americans-cant-cover-a-1000-emergency-expense-with-savings.html), [Healthcare of the USSR and its costs](https://books.google.co.in/books?hl=en&lr=&id=cfI6AAAAIAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA3&dq=Leichter,+Howard+M.:+A+Comparative+Approach+to+Policy+Analysis:+Health+Care+Policy+in+Four+Nations&ots=VkCh9FHEe0&sig=25CSSzR-ntfs6LXJxw8oeFP1CEM&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Leichter%2C%20Howard%20M.%3A%20A%20Comparative%20Approach%20to%20Policy%20Analysis%3A%20Health%20Care%20Policy%20in%20Four%20Nations&f=false)

Now our final comparison of socialism and capitalism is the QOL of the nation. Socialist nations, compared to capitalist nations, In socialist nations, the quality of life is better and development is better, according to a study by the authors [S Cereseto](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/S.-Cereseto/13731260), [Howard Waitzkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Waitzkin). 

Source: [Capitalism, socialism, and the physical quality of life](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2430906/)

Now one question is how about the black book of communism? Well, I made an article on that, it talks about [the black book and western democracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/yhage5/a_critique_of_the_black_book_and_western_democracy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Socialism is better in always when comparing Education, Healthcare, and general quality of life. How about freedom? Well, it depends on our definition, is being debt trapped for going to the hospital freedom? Is not being to afford home freedom? To my definition: You have the right to food, shelter, water, cloth, healthcare, and education. That is freedom, Not the right to wave the confederate flag. Well, why is socialism inevitable? Well, to quote Rosa Luxemburg it is either Socialism or Barbarism. We, humans, have the tendency to think it is the end of history. No, it is not. History won't end till a billion or 2 years. Our way of society and material analysis of our world must come to a standard. I’d recommend this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVWwwfcQ5FA) talks about historical materialism.

728,ymkuk6,Economists say this isn’t another Great Depression. I agree—this is a Greater Depression.,"Humankind has more wealth and power in its possession than at any time in recorded history. Instead of uplifting the people who made and continue to make that possible, businesses and governments write workers off, blame them, and then forget about them. 

The media says people on the Left are “too woke” and out-of-touch. I can’t help but think of the irony; the media, which relies on its influence over “consumers” rests its laurels on the broken pillars of a failing government ready to make way for Q-Anon followers and Stop the Steal militiamen. 

While all of this foolishness plays out before us, no government stands up to address the deteriorating mental health of its people. We who survived COVID-19, we who live with the grim realities of economic catastrophe every 5 to 7 years. We who live with the reality of Right-Wing gunmen shooting up schools, houses of worship, and pushing their narratives of White Supremacy and Christian-Identity.

It doesn’t matter how much we compromise in our lives, or how much we attempt to appease our bosses, managers, and government—the fault rests with the worker. They will fire us. They will let us go. They will tell the public they have bad workers, “They were quiet quitting! No one wants to work anymore!” It will all be to appease their shareholders and customers—-they have to raise their prices while cutting down on labor costs. 

Yes, comrades—this is the Greater Depression. The managers of it are smiling because they know it’s rude to scowl. They can be certain of their victories before a battle has even begun. Their greatest asset is their ability to wield the chaos of their broken workers’ lives to fulfill an agenda bent to the benefit of the wealthy and powerful. 

All we really have is each other. Not as philosophers, political theoreticians, or pundits. As workers. As the Proletariat. We must unite to stand up to those who seek to exploit and use us. Not because we will assuredly win, but because we will have nothing to lose. One who is lost, cannot be found; the lost must find their own way. We will find our way.

Our natural determination, as able-bodied humans, to stand upright, is our noble defiance countering the forces that hold our feet to the ground. It is not shameful to demand respect, to appraise one’s own worth over profit, or to challenge the greed and wickedness of those who have more money than morality.",-5909349236670612998,0

So, we’ve talked about unionising and had discussions with UNITE whilst some of our lab workers are already members of Prospect union which represents scientists and engineers etc.

The catch is that our company doesn’t recognise unions (surprise surprise). Now, I understand that by law we can apply for recognition and if the company refuses then we can get statutory recognition provided we have at least 10% of our bargaining unit paid union members and a majority of them in favour of recognition. 

My plan therefore is to recruit more members in the short term and build up a solid membership base in the manufacturing and lab departments of the company. I estimate that we can get ~80% of both of those departments paid union members which should provide us with a bargaining unit that the company cannot ignore. 

If anyone has any additional advice or thoughts on this please let me know. I would love to talk to other U.K. union members and particularly those at other pharma companies. Many thanks and solidarity to all ✊🚩",-3128033307576724731,0

766,yl2tue,"Reduced motivation for crimes, ""In a just and equitable human society""","In a just and equitable human society, there would be none marginalized, and therefore no motivation to break the established social contract and commit a crime. You would have to have a serious psychiatric condition to commit a crime in such an environment, so no prisons would theoretically be needed, but hospitals might. But that would require society as a whole to value all human life equally.

The establishment of new police forces or increasing police presence has never been statistically shown to have any relevant or beneficial impact on crime rates. The purpose of police departments are generally much more corrupt than crime control - they were first designed, formed, and funded in the US by factory and slave owners hoping for better \*social\* control of their respective labor forces. It wasn't until the 1830's that corporations or other organizations were first able to ""persuade"" local governments to fund their private militias (or ""enforcers"") with taxpayer dollars, to save money on enforcing the proper behavior of labor forces they desired further distance from. Corporations were so successful in their propaganda, that the original name for employees peacefully protesting for better working conditions is now considered far more derogatory ( a ""riot"" ), and they generally no longer even use this term but prefer to describe their actions as ""strikes"".

Similarly, studies have failed to find any significant correlation between incarceration rates and crime rates. 3 million Americans enslaved in prisons, and it's had no effect on crime rates, but has provided cheap slave labor. The 13th amendment luckily carves out a loophole in the ban on slavery and indentured servitude, allowing it for anyone convicted of a crime. We're also lucky that such great lawmakers were able to come up with some very creative new crimes specifically for people of color after the civil war reconstruction period ended, prohibition after WWI, a war on drugs after the civil rights era in the 60s, etc.

But the real key is that it's estimated that 3 out of every 4 incarcerated Americans has a severe psychiatric condition that has never been properly diagnosed or treated. The prisons keep these people safely off the streets where they could be costing taxpayer dollars to treat their various conditions.

This will hopefully allow everyone to get to know each other outside of our political views and discuss anything non-political. You never know, you may actually have similar interests! So to keep in the spirit of our authoritarianism, there are a few things first:

1. The subject matter is to try and stay away from politics please

2. Feel free to ask anything

3. New members are more than welcome to contribute, and this may be a chance to introduce yourself to the sub!

[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-63526167](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-63526167)

It's like he's half-way towards a decent point, that the way you fix NHS staffing is by expanding training in the NHS (though how we do that while we allow the private sector to poach the expensive staff we train, as Streeting's repeatedly pledged, is beyond me).

The problem is that immigration is irrelevant to this: fixing the NHS is a question of both/and, not either/or.

And I realise that there will be some telling us that this is 11D chess involving showing that Labour is somehow ""strong"" on immigration but there are strong arguments that the long term effect of this centrist triangulation are largely negative: Blair's approach here for example led to a provable long-term decline in Labour's vote, it's deeply debateable that it had any effect on the Tory vote, which almost certainly just joined parties like UKIP instead of Labour and [evidence globally is that it leads to a resurgent far right](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2019/09/16/the-brahmin-left-vs-the-merchant-right-a-comment-on-thomas-pikettys-new-book/).

So really all he's done here is promise to undermine the health service by unnecessarily limiting its staffing while putting all the emphasis on the myth that ""concerns about immigration"" are at all respectable.",142556151057227929,0

[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bs1K5rqbNY) his full speech from the ""SME4Labour"" gala.

Catch the bit from 2:15 - 3:05.

>""We had to make our Labour party fit to serve our country. And a huge part of that, a huge part of that right up there, with everything we've done for NATO and national security, is **showing to the British people that this party wants businesses to PROSPER. That we respect the contribution that profit makes, to jobs, to growth, and the taxes which pay for our Public Services.** 

>**We understand that we can only build a fairer, greener Britain by backing the Enterprises that you have built to the hilt.** ""That's why I feel so proud when I see rooms like this, because it shows that we've changed the party.""

And that's just the beginning. He says a lot more after that about his plans for Labour's relationship with business. 

At 3:53

>**Because if we cant to drive our country forward, we need a real partnership between state and market, business and unions. Town and City.** That's how we tackle the country's challenges. By pulling everyone in the same direction. Everyone contributing to a fairer, greener future.

He talked a lot about which areas a Labour government's gonna focus on(Entrepreneurs, green growth, skilling etc) but he didn't mention any new policies other than the ones Labour's already announced, like abolishing business rates. But still I got a lot more detail than I knew before.

----

I thought overall he hit it out of the park. If you're from the business community, an entrepreneur etc. or just work in the private sector you need to see this speech. He really gets what he needs to do for the economy. He's really accepted the role of Labour as a friend and partner of business. :D",-5199389251710428891,0

It isn't simply ""workers vs billionaires"" in Britain","I have highlighted a comment posted here that has over 400 upvotes at current from the recent ""British attitudes to wealth"" thread because it touches on something fundamental to the British economy, from housing crisis to wage stagnation - in turn, understanding this concept collectively is something that can make the left either an effective force or completely inept. The post can be seen here:  [https://imgur.com/a/SlgegHq](https://imgur.com/a/SlgegHq)

The idea that ""we're all in it together"" (anyone remember that phrase?) as a group of workers vs the evil billionaires, no matter whether you're on 10k or 200k is a nice notion, but it is also a nonsense that's used to make sure effective change cannot happen.

Whether you want to call them PMCs (professional managerial classes), bourgeoisie or any other collective terminology, ""workers"" in the upper wage margins are largely not political allies. They have become part of a different class due to their ability to acquire capital - capital which is then used to make normal people's lives more difficult.

The massive decrease in bargaining power for working class people in Britain since the 80s (since industry was destroyed and union membership subsequently attacked/collapsed) has lead to a direct increase in the bargaining power of PMCs (eg £150k a year people).

This has created a massive chasm between the spending and purchasing power of people on lower or median wages, and those on higher incomes. In turn, we see housing crisis, and wage stagnation because working class people are priced out of the market by PMCs who can afford to buy assets like land and housing not to live in, but as a speculative asset to generate profit.

If you have a business of 200 people for example, you have to pay all your workers - skilled or unskilled (I know those terms aren't great but I'm using them for the sake of argument). A unionised workforce can collectively bargain for better wages, meaning there's less in the wage pot for the professional managerial classes - they'll still earn plenty, but they'll earn less - and this is something they don't want.

Because of the destruction of working class people's bargaining power (again, via the far less unionised labour, attacks on the social safety net, pop growth), we've seen a political shift that has normalised psychotic politics like neoliberalism and austerity - these policies **benefit the professional managerial classes while taking from normal and working class people. This is true in both the Tory party and the right wing of the Labour party.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Want to understand why New Labour under Blair had a worse record on inequality than Thatcher and built zero council houses, creating housing crisis?

Want to understand why Keir Starmer is funded by billionaires and hedgefund managers and gives 6 figure payouts to those who intentionally sabotaged Labour's electoral prospects from within the party?

Want to understand why Tory MPs are being invited to the Labour party across the floor while simultaneously suggesting ""we all need to vote labour to get these horrible Tories out"". Why Nye Bevan, a former coal miner, was booted from the party for calling Tories *lower than vermin?*

# It's because there is a chasm not only in life experiences, but in political and economic interests between working class people and those in the professional managerial classes.

If normal working people earn more (like in Scandinavia), prices will go up by some degree, as will the median wage. This means you have a far wider middle class, great for common prosperity and poverty but bad for the bargaining power of the higher earners (PMCs) who previously enjoyed the fruits and low prices of a low wage economy.

A wider middle class via reduced inequality is an excellent thing for Britain as a country but the PMCs, Blairites, Starmerites, Tories,  you name it, all fear it because it reduces the imaginary status they've created for themselves and it **increases competition for them.** Hence the massive hysteria about Jeremy Corbyn's basic Nordic socdem platform.

Want to understand why it wasn't an urgent cost of living crisis in the media over the past two decades while young people saw hundreds of percent increases in their rents and housing costs in relation to their wages? It's because that crisis benefits the wealthiest, therefore it's not a problem.

Working class people derive their bargaining power from collective bargaining (things like unions, threat of strike action, strength in numbers), while PMCs with the free time and capital to invest in more niche skills (or to sell their souls in some cases) derive their bargaining power from there being a limited supply of those skills. This ultra-market approach is completely ok with poverty, as the market doesn't care about poverty, nor humanity, nor society.

Please can we discuss this more? I have already written too much for it to be a fun read, so please do ask questions - I'll gladly to into more depth and I'm sure other people will chime in.

**TLDR; It isn't  simply workers vs billionaires, that's largely a fantasy spread by the upper middle classes to protect their own interests and the status quo.**

928,ymq707,What is wrong with British people's attitudes to wealth?,"UPDATE: Didn't expect this to be seen by so many people! Thank you to everyone who's commented, it's been good to hear people's experiences and opinions, had some very interesting discussions in the comments. All the best to the lot of ya!

What is with British people and wealth? Just saw a post asking whether people on £150k actually have a hard time and the overwhelming response was ""rich people have problems too, they just have a different reality and it's completely valid""... 

Let's put this into context - if you earn £150k, your take home income after tax is £7k PER MONTH. Some people rightly said that over £50k of a £150k salary goes on tax, but it should be the case that the richest in society pay more. They're the only ones that can. That also still leaves you with £7k per month to take home.

Many others said the biggest problem is the companies and millionaires not paying more, and that they're the real rich people. It's right that the super wealthy are the biggest problem and something needs to be done, but still, no one seems to accept that £7k a month is plenty to live on. That's 4x the amount per month that someone on £25k sees. Pointing to bigger companies is just deflecting. 

There were even sob stories about how people on £150k or more have been hit by huge mortgage rises that they just can't afford, but if you take out a mortgage that costs the majority of £7k per month, how do people not see that as irresponsible financial planning? Whatever your salary, if your living costs take up over a certain portion of your income, you're not preparing for a change of income or harder circumstances. The difference is rich people have more room to avoid making this mistake.

Not everyone will get the opportunity to earn £150k, and rich people are incredibly quick to tell the poor to ""budget better"" and ""live within their means"", but when their income is harmed and they claim they spend most of their wealth, we're supposed to feel sorry for them. Someone said that ""people on £150k are closer to homeless people than millionaires and billionaires"", and the logic is correct, but the fact that £7k A MONTH is closer to homelessness than the richest in our society is sickening, and the idea that even that much income isn't a stable amount to live on is frankly ludicrous.

You could argue that taking out huge mortgages is within your means if £150k is your regular salary, and you could also argue that no-one could pre-empt huge interest rate or mortgage rises (and you'd at least be right about the latter). The problem with this is that it massively overlooks the idea of having a ""rainy day fund"". Again, we're always told that if we don't have a rainy day fund, no matter what we earn, we're irresponsible with our finances. The media, the government, the richest and even the poorest all adhere to this line of thinking.

There's nothing wrong with being responsible with your finances, but with the cost of rent/mortgages, transport, food and bills, most people are lucky if they put away couple of hundred pounds each month. Add children and childcare to that mix and your savings are non-existent. 

Case in point: back in 2019 I was on £20 - 21k. I could walk to work, paid moderate rent, and lived in a relatively pricey city. I do not have kids. I made a deliberate note to put away £200 a month every month to build up some savings, and in just over a year and a half, I had put away about £3.5k. That's HALF of what someone on £150k earns A MONTH. Unfortunately for me, I lost my job in the pandemic and ended up on Universal Credit. Those savings disappeared within 6 months and I fell back into an overdraft.

Did I go out for a beer with my friends every now and then? Absolutely. Could I have saved even more per month? Sure. Would it have saved me much more each month? Hardly likely (and it definitely would have made life significantly more miserable). Two years later and I have finally recovered from my financial losses. (Not a sob story, just using it as an example). 

If you're earning £7k per month and you can't amass a rainy day fun that could cover your living costs for 6 months, how are you living within your means? And why should people feel sorry for you for having more of a chance to prepare for the worst and refusing to do so?

Don't get me wrong, you should be able to have a better lifestyle with a better salary, but not seeing that those additional earnings are a significant privilege is astounding. Not recognising your misue of that privilege is not worthy of sympathy and does not ""put you in the same boat as everyone else"", and the fact that the UK at large doesn't seem to recognise the disparity between £150k and many other salaries is infuriating. It's even worse that the UK perpetually tells the poor that losing money is their fault for being ""financial irresponsible"" but rich people can fail to prepare and that's supposed to deserve sympathy.

417,ydk3bw,Some encouraging words to our Users,"To all our users and our guests, these upcoming elections hold promise for all Americans. There are many on this platform who absolutely despise us, and while I am quite alarmed by their vitriol, I wish them well and hope they see we are not the evil folks they seem to think we are. Show them grace, show them dignity, but show them the truth. Be especially patient with those who seem open, let them see who you are. There are many middle of the road folks who need only see the direction of the country to know where they probably ought to vote, but those more deeply entrenched will require patience and grace that is hard to muster when they may go as far as wishing us dead. Speak truth to that, but speak love to it, too.

Folks, I would like to point out that we have many in our own camp who need that same grace and patience. I work in deep red territory within a deep blue state. It is not often felt in the community, but these folks can feel like outsiders in their own homes. They know where they live and they have had to harden themselves a bit to maintain. They aren't threatened existentially, but they know how they are perceived, their own governor says they aren't real members of the state. This has led to some digging in of their heels, even turning to some not-so-helpful sentiments. While I don't see it as a major trend, I do see young Americans who do not understand the complexity of race issues and identity issues. They may have a good, rational stance but they may also act and speak in ways that do not help and can, frankly, embarrass us.

They need our grace and our patience, too. They need it sometimes more than anyone else, because they could be good ambassadors if only they knew how. They need our example so set it for them.

Folks, if you you have young people in your lives in any way, as a parent, a teacher, a postal employee who walks past a few on your route, whatever it may be... be an example. Sure, we need people who are not afraid to speak the truth and are willing to boldly state what they believe, but that does not mean insulting people who are not in agreement with you.

I am proud of some of the candidates I see out there right now. They are not callous and careless in their actions and speech, they are assertive in their convictions and they come to the table with the statistics and points to back them up. They are not scaring or turning people away with uncomfortable, ignorant, or aggressive speech. They are inspiring people with confidence and clarity in their arguments; they are forcing those who attempt to lie about them back with the truth and then hitting them with even more truth.

If you are not someone who makes strong arguments, don't. Support those who do and guide people there. If you can't find the words to convince someone, don't. Point them to people and platforms that can and then speak with your actions. Show them your character. If you don't know how to lead, serve those who can with integrity, and serve with the desire to see those who do lead to find more like you. You may not be a leader in the movement, but you are a leader in your family; act like it.

Serve others and find joy in this world. Show those who would hate you that you can enjoy life, not to spite them in their anger, but because life is worth enjoying even when so much is at stake.

Folks, I would like to encourage the believers of Christ here and I would like to encourage those who may have desired to know that there is a creator of this universe and to have a relationship with Him.

It struck me recently in a conversation with a moderator that much of what the left's media has done to the right and to conservatives is what has happened to Christianity over the years. Christianity has been twisted and confused by those who control narratives; it has been sold as something it is not; Christ's name has been used by very powerful people to justify all kinds of things despite the words of Christ himself not condoning their actions; it has been factioned, and weakened, and watered down. It has been berated into something that believes the lie that it oppresses. All of this has been done to Christianity, and yet still it resides in so many hearts and the truth of it lives on.

Folks, one of the deepest wounds to Christianity is done by Christians. A person seeking truth is turned away by an arrogant Christian. A person hoping to find answers is discouraged by the Christian who thinks they know better. A person who is hoping to meet God is lost to ruin because of the Christian who gossiped and judged.

There is room and even necessity for righteous anger in a Christian's life at times; there is room and even a requirement to speak harsh truth, or sad truth, or unsettling truth. Christ turned over the money tables when people were using the temple to make money; Christ called people fools and vipers at times. I would say he rarely did so to save those he rebuked, though it could have helped; he did so to save those who saw what was happening, but hadn't the courage to speak to what was wrong. Christ spoke loud the ills of society, but welcomed many who lived and perpetuated those ills.

Be that Christian. 

Fellow Republicans, be that Republican.

To my Republican friends of other faiths. You are leaders, too. You are role models, too. You are ambassadors, too. We can have a rich, diverse nation, but only if we all attempt to be what we know is good. I am so proud that the right is creating a more and more diverse base. I want to see crowds that the average democrat who hates us will look at and think, ""if they are racists, why are they all so happy rallying with each other?"" We are getting there! But I don't want diversity for the sake of diversity. I want diversity because, despite our differences, we know what is good and what makes this country great. I want diversity because I don't care what we are individually, I care about our character and I want to gather with people who feel the same. So please don't take my call to Christians as exclusionary. I am proud to stand with gays, with blacks, with Hispanics, with Jews, with Asians, with Muslims, with Atheists, with anyone who believes in the right to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.

Whatever happens this election, it is an opportunity to speak truth. Whatever happens this election, it is an opportunity to show grace. Whatever happens this election, it is an opportunity to love.

But whatever happens this election matters little if you do not attempt to live life like you know we should.

Good bless you all.",4567205365540357047,1

New parties that split off from older parts entered the Parlament: Danish Democrats (split from the Danish People's Party) and the Moderates (split from Venstre).

But the big win is arguably for the Liberal Alliance party, a libertarian party. They went from 4 seats in the previous election to 14 seats. This is interesting, since last year in Argentina, 4 libertarian politicians were elected into their Parliament, and according to some sources, the Libertarians are now polling around 30%.

780,yfw4l5,How the federal government caused minorities in the U.S. to struggle,"As someone who is quite inquisitive in the sense where I like to learn more about different things, I wanted to learn more about why things are the way they are. Why are life circumstances the way they are for everyone right now? And after research, and time to think, I've came to the conclusion that everything we see around us, it's all by design. Have you ever wondered why drugs in the U.S. are a problem when several decades ago it wasn't?

I believe the federal governments destruction of minority communities started in the late 70s. Jimmy Carter was a radical liberal for his time. And he proposed Welfare bills and Food stamp bills for various amounts of people. For people unemployed, single parents trying to raise kids, and people just struggling. This on paper sounds fine, and granted, some people do take advantage of it, but at the time of it's inception, it was fine. But later on events only made things worse.

In the 80s, when the U.S. was trying to stop Communism from expanding, the C.I.A. was of course aiding anti-communist factions in various countries. In order to help this one gang gather enough money for weapons and supplies, the C.I.A. (under Regan) started selling crack and other drugs into American cities and towns with the gangs so they could raise money. That was a horrible mistake. The U.S. is still suffering today, and even our neighbors down south, thanks to that. The drugs ended up targeting minority communities too. And then to make things worse, Regan created the [Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1986) as a part of the War on Drugs to make the Government seem innocent when they designed the issue themselves. Then, there was the icing on the cake.

In the 90s, then Senator Joe Biden, along with President Bill Clinton started passing out excessive and ruthless crime bills targeting minorities in their respective locations, the laws went after the most stupid things too such as Marijuana, non-violent gun offenses, and so on. Many were arrested because of this. And this is when society really focused on the concept of police brutality and the police having too much power. This is when a cycle was created. People are suffering from illegal drug abuse. People get sent to brutal prisons due to that, and are took away from their families, kids, spouses.

Single mothers raising kids get put on welfare and food stamps and no longer have to work. Then kids growing up in poverty, around drugs, and with their fathers taken away and traumatized by it and then they are more likely to grow up and ""commit crime"", it's an endless cycle, rinse and repeat. Now, with all that being said, did Carter, Regan, the C.I.A., Clinton and Biden all tend for things to be this way? Did they all want minorities to struggle? I'm honestly not too sure. The main reason is because all of these bills and operations happened decades apart. But regardless, now they have all came together and caused a big problem, and left wing or right wing, it's all thanks to the federal government.

So, what can we do about this? Well, we need to ease drug and gun laws, release those for drug crimes and those who committed non-violent gun offenses. Make drugs legal, and then those making money from them illegally won't make as much if drugs are easier to obtain and legal tender. Most people likely wouldn't do heroin or crack at this point anyways because many of us know how harmful they can be. Laws with food stamps and welfare checks should be at the state level, not federal. I don't think these solutions will completely fix the issues started, but I believe they can make things not as bad.",-1671058639709296903,1

* Not older than 15 years (recent developments within ASOE should be included)
* Introduction to all relevant concepts / show the differences to mainstream economics
* Not relying on praxeology (I tried reading Mises Human Action, but was not impressed)

If you take a large sample of houses with cats, and just opened the door and let the cats leave, some would. Some would die, some would struggle, some would thrive. Some would come back, some would go be happy to never see you again.

But you won't *LET* them leave. You are afraid that after everything you've done for the cat, the cat would just fuck off and leave. You are afraid that the dependency you projected onto the cat isn't real. That the cat does not need you, as much as you need it. You need to feel like a good person by ""taking care of"" the cat. But you never stopped to think if the cat wants or needs you to take care of it, or if it's just stuck in the system you locked it into.

* 18 year old female
* apolitical
* away for college, living in SoCal
* Avid book reader (all forms of fiction and some classics)

Perhaps someone can recommend a more contemporary fiction book(s) akin to Atlas Shrugged. Something that would be engaging to a young college student. She has already read Atlas Shrugged.

Rooting for the under dog type. The thought that people are individuals. To push liberty and justice for all like the pledge of allegiance says.

WHAT THE FUCK HAPPEND? 
 proxy wars, regime changes, our overall interventionist policies.

Why in America can not one politician or mainstream media outlet ever state ""hey we are fucking up""?

We destroyed the middle east: Iraq, iran, Syria, Afghanistan under the pretense of 9/11 after we had already been exploiting that region for years. Then called 9/11 ""unprovoked"" lied about the WMD's and it kept us over there for 20 years.

We help Saudis massacre the people in Yemen 

We were fucking around with Ukraine since the cold War trying to pull it out from Russian control since then. They had already stated  it was a redline for them we staged a coup to push out the pro Russian and helped install a pro west goverment more favorable to America during obamas term, trump gave weapons to Ukraine that were going to be used to fight the Russians and biden has funded them with substantially more money and weapons since the start of the war and every politician and mainstream media outlet is calling the war ""unprovoked"" wtf is that? 

We are constantly preforming regime changes causing destabilization across the world and nobody wants to say anything about how we shouldn't be doing that other than maybe Rand Paul.

Even the last bill that was introduced that was supposed to give money to Florida for hurricane relief had 12 billion going to Ukraine. Luckily it was shot down but still. 

Are we just so far removed from reality that most Americans can't even acknowledge that we shouldn't be doing this? And That it's somehow partly our fault for this Ukraine war? (I'm not condoning the invasion) just the fact we are partly to blame for pushing putin to such extreme measures.

All of these things hurt America as a whole especially when we have so much internal strife right now between regular people. 

Is there any type of messaging that can be put forth that could reign in the war hawks or is it our destiny to call ourselves the world police and just exploit the rest of the world through the things aforementioned.",6387523670030158561,1

By rejecting this case, the SCOTUS is reinforcing a two-party regime that only stays in power by illegitimately suppressing all opposition from outside the two major parties.

People need to start to stand up for third party rights. We cannot win at the ballot box if they systematically ban us from ever trying. The two parties want to suppress your voice and your vote, and will do so in any way they can. We need to stop this. We need to bring this into the public eye, hold mass demonstrations, and demand the introduction of a real choice of candidates, rather than being forced by the state to vote for only Democrats or Republicans. The permanent loss of Georgia is devastating, but we need to act now if we are to ever save this country.

In a free market world without state regulation, how could medium-sized companies survive? 

Let me explain: 

Let's imagine the scenario in which Qatar Airways, a company with almost unlimited financing, decides to open operations in Latin America. On entering this new market, they decide that in order to break their competitors or force them to sell, they will give free flights to everyone for 6 months (given that their economic power allows them to do so). Their competitors cannot maintain their operations without customers and their customers decide to go to Qatar Airways because their service is free. Eventually their competitors go bankrupt and Qatar Airways starts charging on a regular basis but this time with full control of the market and the moment a new competitor appears they could do the same and eliminate them. 

In this case I used the aviation industry, but it can really happen with any industry. 

What is a non-regulatory solution to this?

Given that deficit spending is exponentially growing and nobody in power seems to be learning their lesson (most politicians don’t even fundamentally understand that overspending causes inflation), there has to be a tipping point where we spend such an absurd amount that we don’t recover. I’m curious if anyone had seen any economist try to calculate this based on the current trajectory of growth of debt?

I remember I saw some answer on Quora on how a fascist(not a fascist myself) state would be better than a democracy, basically it boiled down to these points:

A single party will have an easier time improving lives than a system to several parties always arguing.

No multi party elections mean politicians can focus on stuff that matters.

State surveillance would drastically bring down crime rates because everyone is being watched.

Censoring news prevents moral corruption.

An economic system where state, companies, and labor work in tandem works better than a system where the three groups are against each other as in capitalism.

I pulled this list from Everytown, hopefully it can stay as objective as possible, though there are certainly items that are broad in scope.

   6. No guns at state capitols and/or political demonstrations
   7. No guns in bars
   8. No guns in K-12 schools

It's a bit silly to me that people call the country being invaded by a pseudo fascist like Putin the Nazis.

985,x08gg1,Conversation about Switzerland Gun culture vs USA..can we learn anything from them and reduce gun violence?,"

So I recently made a post with a guy having a rifle on the train in Switzerland and people reacting to it. 
The guy is just required to take a mandatory shooting test once a year at the range and he’s going home on the train. He has no magazine in the gun they load it at the range. 
I was just curious to see the comments but it turned out to be a valuable learning experience for me when a bunch of People who live in Switzerland joined in and I started to talk to them about gun laws and Swiss gun culture and problems we are facing here in Usa with our own issues regarding this topic.

I wanted to share with you what I learned talking to them after asking them this question: “While I have your attention I would love to ask your opinion on this..USA gets compared to Switzerland often with gun laws and gun murders and mass shootings etc..Swiss has very strong gun culture probably only USA has stronger gun culture but Switzerland doesn’t have all the gun murders and also doesn’t have the mass shootings. In your opinion why is there such a difference between the two countries? Some will say that Switzerland has stronger gun laws so that’s the reason others say it’s because Swiss are happy people with good education, good jobs, healthcare, low poverty and also a strong sense of community which is why in general crime is so low..what do you think of all this?”

Swiss citizens did tell me flat out they do have much stronger gun laws than we do and many of the laws realistically wouldn’t fly here in USA especially people aren’t able to carry in public. But most of the answers showed many other factors at play which makes them very different than what happens in USA. I will now give you actual answers given to me by people who decided to talk to me about the issue:

“About the crimes, i see it exactly the way you described: It is about stability and wealth. Happy people don't commit crimes, they don't go on a deadly rampage. Almost all crimes with guns come from foreigners with illegal guns, the only real case i remember was Leibacher, the guy that shot multiple people in the parliament of the canton Zug in 2001. This guy was paranoid and in his insane mind, he thought everyone would be in a conspiracy against him. So it can happen, but it is very rare.

But again, it is really about the society, we don't have much problems here. Like with the direct democracy, you can participate in politics as a citizen without needing a party and you have a lot of rights. This leads to a great stability with almost no protests on the streets.

Then about crime, we don't have such things like street gangs. Even the drug dealers don't carry guns, it's just not needed even in this illegal business.”

Here is another answer: “What we have is conscription, a 2 days draft during which you can choose between military service, two forms of labour in the public interest or a compensatory tax. Also this only applies to Swiss or naturalised males (so not everyone in Switzerland), which is roughly 38% of the population. If you break down the numbers, only about 17% of a given birthyear actually enter the army.
By the way not everyone gets issued a gun and you can also choose to serve unarmed
If you‘re fit for service you can chose between army and civilian service.
If you‘re only partly fit for service you do civilian defense (different from civilian service).
If you‘re unfit for service you pay a tax.”

Here are some other points other than the gun laws: “I think it is a combination of both plus a third factor. We have mandatory military service for men, so many people learn how to handle guns properly.

A fourth point can be cultural differences itself. We treat crimes differently. For example using drugs isn’t really considered a crime, more as an addiction. So if you get caught driving a car, you will loose your license but you will also be helped loosing that addiction.

Prison is for many people also like a rehabilitation facility and less punishment. We try to bring these people back into normal lifes because otherwise they would fall into crime again.

Another example for the cultural difference is driving a car. Here and many (if not all) European Countries you need to complete a first aid/ emergency responder course. If someone has an accident in front of you, you are legally obliged to help (because you did that course). So helping others should be embedded in culture here.”

“The main difference would be that we sont really have the factors that cause such problems in the US:

We have low socioeconomic disparities, almost no racism (at least not to the extent of the US), good access to education, good access to health and mental care, strong social net/state, etc...
You remove incentives, you remove crimes”

Another person said this: “minimise the reasons why people would commit crimes in the first place. Eg pay everyone a living wage, make education affordable, re-integrate convicts after prison sentences, social welfare, etc”

So I learned a great deal from talking to them they have great education there, people also make good money a waiter can make 4200 a month plus tips the trade off is that very high paying jobs like lawyers and doctors make less than USA. They have a strong sense of community and people look out for one another you can actually get in trouble if someone is in a car accident and you didn’t stop to help them since people are trained in first aid while driving a vehicle. 

They have good healthcare and mental healthcare there as well and they screen people for aggression before they can own a Gun or join the military. The most important thing is that they create a culture and environment where committing gun murders hardly ever crosses anyone’s mind since they are pretty happy people overall and satisfied with their lives and they take personal responsibility for many things there. Well I just wanted to share a little what I learned and hope you will share what you learned from talking to any people from Switzerland or other countries on how things can be better here in USA. I know Gun control advocates will only focus on gun laws there but Swiss laws realistically will never fly here if we are being honest but there’s plenty of other things we can do to make life better and reduce gun deaths in USA.",-7443852264909810378,1

Several pending cases were also remanded to lower courts for new proceedings in light of the Bruen decision.  This is really good news for the pro-gun crowd.  I have been trying to find a comprehensive list of state law changes and challenges so I can follow their progress and see how the laws are changing around the country.  I figured most people here would be interested in a list like that, even if just to see how things are going in your own state.  Below is what I found so far, mostly from this [article](https://www.thetrace.org/2022/08/nysrpa-v-bruen-challenge-gun-regulations/).  Please feel free to comment with additional cases of interest, or any other information that might be interesting or useful as we watch these cases progress.

**GUN LAW / POLICY CHANGES**

**California**

On June 24, Attorney General Rob Bonta directed permitting agencies to stop requiring a demonstration of “good cause” in order to obtain a concealed carry permit, as it was now “unconstitutional and unenforceable.” He said they could still use other gauges of suitability, like “good moral character,” and suggested criteria for determining whether an applicant qualifies, including social media searches, character references, a history of racist behavior, financial stability, and honesty and trustworthiness. Bonta also said that permitting authorities can still ask why an applicant wants to carry a gun, even if the answer is no longer allowed to factor into their decision.

On July 22, a Los Angeles Police Department commander directed sworn personnel to stop enforcing the state’s high-capacity magazine ban, which the Supreme Court vacated in light of Bruen. Until the case is decided, officers are not to “investigate, detain, or arrest” anyone suspected of possessing ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds unless they are a prohibited purchaser, the LAPD confirmed to The Trace.

**Delaware**

Delaware, a may-issue state, doesn’t appear to have issued guidance on how Bruen will affect the state’s concealed carry permitting laws. But a week after the ruling, Governor John Carney signed legislation that bans assault weapons; raises the age for buying semiautomatic rifles to 21; caps magazine capacity at 17 rounds; creates an avenue to sue gun makers and sellers; bans machine gun conversion devices; and revives the state’s gun background check system.

**Maryland**

On July 5, Governor Larry Hogan directed the Maryland State Police to stop using a “good and substantial reason” standard when evaluating concealed carry permit applicants. In response, leaders in the Democrat-led state Legislature have vowed to pass new concealed carry restrictions. 

On July 12, the local council in Montgomery County, disappointed by Bruen, introduced a bill that would ban guns “in or near places of public assembly.” A couple of weeks later, the Montgomery County State’s Attorney said he would be dropping illegal gun carry charges against people who were denied a concealed carry permit because they didn’t meet the “good and substantial reason” standard.

**Massachusetts**

On July 1, Attorney General Maura Healey said “licensing authorities can no longer enforce the “good reason” provision of the state’s concealed carry law. Healey issued guidance that the “suitability” requirement was unaffected by Bruen.

Shortly after the ruling, police departments around the state began to lift restrictions on concealed carry permits that were limited to hunting or target shooting only. The change could affect nearly 20,000 gun owners. By mid-July, Boston had “unrestricted” nearly 250 such licenses, while Springfield had unrestricted 53. 

On August 1, the state legislature passed a measure that would amend concealed carry laws to comply with Bruen. It includes language that removes “a reasonable exercise of discretion” on the part of licensing authorities, eliminates a requirement that applicants have “good reason to fear injury,” and replaces the word “may” with “shall” in the state statute, reflecting the transition from may-issue to shall-issue. The bill also requires in-person interviews with licensing authorities and adds new categories of prohibited carriers, including people subject to temporary and permanent harassment prevention orders and people who have exhibited behavior that suggests they would be a danger to themselves or others. Republican Governor Charlie Baker is expected to sign the legislation.

**New Jersey**

On June 24, Acting Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin told prosecutors and law enforcement agencies that the state’s “justifiable need” requirement was no longer enforceable. Platkin emphasized that “the ruling does not change any other aspect of New Jersey’s public carry laws,” which include comprehensive background checks, character references from three people you’ve known for at least three years, and firearms training. 

**New York** 

On July 1, Governor Kathy Hochul signed the Concealed Carry Improvement Act, which imposes a number of regulations on the public carry of firearms, including: a ban on guns in “sensitive locations” like public transit, government buildings, places of worship, polling places, medical facilities, bars, and Times Square; a provision that automatically designates all private property to be a gun-free zone unless the property owner deems otherwise; 18 hours of required firearm training; and a requirement that applicants furnish a list of social media accounts as part of a background check investigation.

The striking of New York’s proper cause requirement didn’t remove limitations on permits limited to carrying a gun while hunting or during target practice. Right now it’s unclear if and how that will happen — authorities who issue pistol permits say they’re still awaiting guidance from the governor.

**Rhode Island**

On July 19, Attorney General Peter Neronha announced that the state’s unique dual permitting system — which provides two avenues for obtaining a carry permit, one may-issue and one shall-issue — is not affected by Bruen. Residents can still go to their local licensing authority and apply for a permit without “a proper showing of need,” or they can apply to the Attorney General’s Office, which does require a proper showing of need and uses discretion when issuing permits.


**GUN LAW CHALLENGES**

**California**

* Boland v. Bonta: On August 1, the California Rifle and Pistol Association filed suit to overturn the state’s 1999 Unsafe Handgun Act, which established safety standards for handguns. If a pistol is deemed unsafe, it can’t be sold by licensed dealers. The plaintiffs argue that the regulation wouldn’t pass the history-and-tradition test set forth in Bruen. At least two previous attempts to void the law have failed.

* Duncan v. Bonta: On June 30, the Supreme Court sent a challenge to the state’s high-capacity magazine ban back to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the ban in November 2021. The case was brought by the California Rifle & Pistol Association and a group of private citizens, who argue that the law is unconstitutional because it provides no exceptions for magazines owned before the law took effect, and thus violates a Fifth Amendment clause that protects against the confiscation of legally acquired property. They also argue that because the devices are “widely owned,” the ban conflicts with SCOTUS’s ruling in 2008’s District of Columbia v. Heller that weapons “typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes” are protected by the Second Amendment. In their initial complaint, the plaintiffs asked the courts to determine whether the two-step framework that lower courts used to decide gun cases — which took into account not just precedent, but also the public-safety ramifications of the law — is consistent with the Second Amendment. Since Bruen rewrote that framework, scuttling the consideration of modern-day factors, this question no longer applies. On August 2, the Ninth Circuit asked lawyers for both sides to submit supplemental briefs on how they believe Bruen affects the case.

* Martinez v. Villanueva: On July 6, California’s Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has sided with gun-rights groups in recent years, vacated a decision regarding pandemic-related gun store and shooting range closures in Los Angeles County and returned the case to a district court. A Ninth Circuit panel ruled in January that the closures “burden the core of the Second Amendment right at a time of crisis, precisely when the need to exercise that right becomes most acute.” The defendants, which include a slew of state officials, had requested that the case be remanded to the district court on the grounds that a similar case in nearby Ventura County was remanded in light of Bruen. The plaintiffs include the National Rifle Association, the Firearms Policy Coalition, the Second Amendment Foundation, and the California Gun Rights Foundation.

* Miller v. Bonta: On August 1, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated a June 2021 ruling that struck down the state’s 30-year-old assault weapons ban, and sent the case back to a district court for reconsideration in light of Bruen. In the 2021 ruling, U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez, who’s frequently sided with gun rights advocates, said AR-15s are like Swiss Army knives, “a perfect combination of home defense weapon and homeland defense equipment.” The case will return to his courtroom.

* Rhode v. Bonta: On June 24, the Ninth Circuit asked the parties involved in an ongoing challenge to the state’s 2016 ammunition background check law to prepare supplemental briefs in light of Bruen. The case was brought in 2018 by the California Rifle & Pistol Association and a group of ammunition retailers and private citizens, who argue that provisions that implement a vendor-licensing system and prohibit direct mail-order ammunition sales essentially “ban millions of constitutionally protected ammunition transfers and heavily burden countless millions more.” The law took effect in July 2019.

* Rupp v. Bonta: On June 28, the Ninth Circuit sent a 2017 challenge to the state’s assault weapons ban back to a district court “for further proceedings consistent with” the Bruen decision. The plaintiffs, which include the California Rifle & Pistol Association and several private citizens, are arguing that semiautomatic rifles are “in common use by millions of Americans for self-defense” and thus protected by Heller. They also say the criteria that California uses to determine whether a gun is an “assault weapon” — features including pistol grips, adjustable stocks, and flash suppressors — “have [nothing] to do with rate of fire, ammunition capacity, power, or anything else linked to the rifle’s potential to be exploited for crime.”

**Colorado**

* Rocky Mountain Gun Owners v. Town of Superior: On July 7, two gun groups, Rocky Mountain Gun Owners and the National Association for Gun Rights, joined a local resident in bringing a challenge to Superior’s semiautomatic rifle ban, enacted a year after a mass shooting at a supermarket in nearby Boulder left 10 people dead. The plaintiffs argue that the ordinance contradicts the history-and-tradition framework that Bruen directed lower courts to apply to Second Amendment cases. On July 22, U.S. District Judge Raymond Moore, an appointee of Barack Obama, agreed, concluding that the “plaintiffs have a strong likelihood of success on the merits” and issuing a temporary restraining order halting enforcement of the ordinance. More lawsuits could follow: The city councils in Boulder and Louisville approved assault weapon bans in June, and Boulder County is considering one.

* Gates v. Polis: On July 28, Rocky Mountain Gun Owners and a group of private citizens filed suit in U.S. District Court to reverse the state’s 2013 ban on ammunition magazines that hold more than 15 rounds. The plaintiffs argue that the 2020 Colorado Supreme Court ruling that upheld the ban should be vacated and redecided according to the history-and-tradition test set forth in Bruen.

**Delaware**

* Delaware State Sportsmen’s Association v. Delaware Department of Safety and Homeland Security: On July 20, an NRA-backed consortium of local gun rights groups filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court challenging the state’s three-week-old law prohibiting sales of certain semiautomatic rifles. The plaintiffs, which include local gun groups and private citizens, argue that since Delaware’s assault weapons ban was inspired by Maryland’s, and the Supreme Court vacated a challenge to Maryland’s ban and sent it back to a lower court for reconsideration because of Bruen, Delaware’s ban should be voided.

**Florida**

* United States v. Matthew Raymond Hoover: On July 1, Hoover, a gun dealer and YouTuber who was charged in January with conspiring to illegally distribute machine gun conversion devices, asked a U.S. District Court in Florida to dismiss the charges on the grounds that the 1934 federal law regulating machine guns doesn’t pass Bruen’s history-and-tradition test. Hoover’s lawyers go even further, asking the judge to rule the National Firearms Act unconstitutional. They cite 88-year-old Senate testimony in which then-Attorney General Homer Stille Commings admitted that lawmakers enacted a tax on machine guns instead of an outright ban in order to dodge questions of constitutionality.

**Hawaii** 

* Young v. Hawaii: On June 30, the Supreme Court returned a challenge to the state’s open carry licensing scheme to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The lower court had upheld the ban in March 2021. The plaintiff, George Young, is seeking to eliminate the requirement that gun owners demonstrate “the urgency or the need” to obtain a permit to openly carry a gun for the purposes of “the protection of life and property.” Young applied for an open carry license in 2011 but authorities determined he didn’t meet the “urgency and need” standard. The law’s defenders argue that openly carrying firearms can incite violent behavior and intimidate members of the public, and make it harder for police to identify public safety threats.

**Illinois**

* Second Amendment Arms v. City of Chicago: On June 28, U.S. District Court Judge Robert Dow Jr. asked lawyers involved in a challenge to Chicago’s 2010 ban on gun laser sights to offer arguments on how Bruen impacts the case. “The court is particularly interested in whether the parties believe that the Supreme Court’s framework impacts the analysis and/or result,” he wrote. The laser sight ban is the last remaining issue in a case that was brought by a gun dealer in 2010.

**Maryland**

* Bianchi v. Frosh: On June 30, the Supreme Court sent a challenge to the state’s assault weapons ban back down to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in light of Bruen’s new methodology. The Fourth Circuit upheld the ban in 2017, ruling that semiautomatic rifles and high-capacity magazines were “dangerous and unusual weapons” and not protected by the Second Amendment under the standards set forth by Heller. The plaintiffs argue that semiautomatic rifles like AR-15s are “in common use” and thus protected by the Second Amendment. “There is no text, history, tradition of banning these certain types of rifles,” said Mark W. Pennak, the president of the gun group Maryland Shall Issue, one of the plaintiffs in the unsuccessful 2017 challenge to the ban.

* Prince George’s County, Maryland - A public defender successfully used Bruen to get illegal gun possession charges dismissed on the grounds that the state law criminalizing carrying a handgun without a permit is now unconstitutional. Another attempt, by a public defender in Baltimore who argued that “there is no sufficient historical tradition of banning firearm possession by drug felons” failed.

**New Jersey**

* New Jersey Rifle & Pistol Clubs v. Bruck: On June 30, the Supreme Court sent a challenge to the state’s ban on high-capacity magazines back to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the law in 2020. The plaintiff, a member of the Association of New Jersey Rifle & Pistol Clubs, is arguing that the 2018 ban is unconstitutional because it provides no exceptions for magazines owned before the law took effect, and thus violates a Fifth Amendment clause that protects against the confiscation of legally acquired property. They also argue that the devices are “widely owned,” and conflict with Heller’s ruling that weapons “typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes” are protected by the Second Amendment. The law’s defenders say that limiting the number of rounds in a magazine can save lives, as gunmen must stop to reload, providing opportunities for bystanders to intervene. Several mass shooters and would-be mass shooters have been stopped this way. 

**New York**

* Antonyuk v. Bruen, brought by Gun Owners of America, seeks to strike the requirement that concealed carry applicants furnish a list of their social media accounts as part of their background check. The suit also takes issue with the “good moral character” requirement, calling it a “standardless notion” that contradicts Bruen’s ruling that authorities shouldn’t be granted the discretion “to deny licenses based on a perceived lack of need or suitability.” The plaintiffs also want to eliminate a longstanding requirement that applicants supply at least four character references. 

* Corbett v. Hochul is also challenging the social media requirement, as well as new training requirements that mandate 18 hours of firearms instruction.

* Paladino v. Bruen seeks to strike the part of the law that designates private property a gun-free zone by default.

* Lewis v. James, filed on July 8, seeks to overturn the state’s 2013 assault weapons ban based on the history-and-tradition test.

* Vanchoff V. James, filed on July 12 by the Firearms Policy Coalition, also seeks to overturn the state’s assault weapons ban based on the history-and-tradition framework.

**New York City** 

* Public defenders have been asking judges to dismiss gun possession charges on the assertion that Bruen renders the state’s 121-year-old gun permit statute unconstitutional. The tactic has been used in at least seven cases, four of which were unsuccessful. In rejecting the argument, a Manhattan Supreme Court judge wrote that “failing to seek a license before roaming the streets with a loaded firearm is not abiding by the law, and nothing in the Second Amendment requires that it be tolerated. The Constitution is not a suicide pact.” For its part, the Legal Aid Society says that lawmakers should “focus on real solutions to gun violence, which lie outside of the criminal legal system.”

**Washington, D.C.**

* Angelo v. District of Columbia: On June 30, four licensed concealed carriers in Washington, D.C., filed suit in U.S. District Court to overturn the gun ban on the district’s transit system. The plaintiffs argue that the ban won’t pass Bruen’s history-and-tradition test.",-3560124007370473302,1

1085,w83gvs,How libertarianism helps poor people,"It's important to explain to people that our ideas would be good for poor people, not just by saying that they'll help themselves, we need to explain how and give real life examples. I have a few examples.

**Example 1:**

Occupational licensing hurts poor people the most. They don't have money to go to classes or pay the license fees and they get stuck in poverty. There's so many barbers or hair braiders in poor communities and they are very good at it, but legally they can't make money off it because they're not licensed.

**Example 2:**

It took my uncle 5 months to open a food truck here in New Mexico. That's how long it took to get all the requirements and paperwork together. Reducing red tape and regulations would help poor people a lot

**Example 3:**

I grew up in a trailer park, and my parents started selling candy and ice cream out of our home to all the kids in the trailer park. It would help pay the bills, the owner of the trailer park didn't have a problem with it, but since we had a sign outside, the cops showed up and made us shut it down.

**Example 4:**

I work on doordash and other apps like that. I love it. I don't have a boss, I choose my own hours, and I make more than I did at a minimum wage job. The only bad thing about it is the taxes, cause there's a self employment tax and so the taxes are higher than at a normal job, but it's still a good gig. In California they tried to force us to be employees instead of independent contractors. Its frustrating that they think they know better than me. I chose this job, if I wanted a normal job I would get a normal job, but I like being an independent contractor. Thank God for doordash and Uber for these opportunities they've created

**Example 5:**

I live in a Hispanic area and during the holidays theres always all these old ladies selling tamales out of their truck on the side of the road or outside stores. So many of them get shut down because they don't have permits and it's not inspected, but they should be able to sell their tamales. If you are afraid that it's unsafe then don't buy from them, but let the rest of us live free.

This is what we mean by economic freedom and talking about real life examples like these will show people that we do care about poor people, and that's why we are libertarians",-3605716791728793729,1

1088,w98c4c,some thoughts on capitalism,"What an incredible system! The fact that its survived under any circumstance. Not even the socialist governments of the USSR and the CCP could escape it. Even at the height of their socialist days they still produced commodities that were bought and sold on a marketplace. They still had a wealthy upper class that made money off the working class and worked closely with politicians. Their governments still operated by commodity logic. This is why everything is produced in China these days! Because not even they could escape capitalism. By selling their goods to the world by using cheap labor, they are acting *within* a capitalist system. Not outside of it...


Its almost like no matter what governments do, they can never exist outside of the logic of capital and commodification! Ever noticed how all communist governments eventually turned back into some form of capitalism? Places like North Korea and Cuba cant exist without participating in the global market in some form. Capitalism encompasses the whole world! It goes deeper than politics and ideology!!! Even deeper than human will!!!  Why would you not support it!

We haven’t seen the dollar this strong since the early 2000’s which begs the question, what does this mean for the global economy? 

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21002932

The dollar is the most common currency of choice for debt contracts worldwide. According to the Bank for International Settlements. 

https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/emerging-markets-drive-global-debt-record-303-trillion-iif-2022-02-23/

Global debt has hit a record high of over $300 trillion dollars. 

https://www.thebalance.com/how-the-dollar-impacts-commodity-prices-809294

Commodity trades among countries are mostly settled in dollars. Things like agriculture, energy, and metals.

Opinion: 

Now that I’ve given you the facts I’d like to share my thoughts. 

The global economy will suffer as a result of the dollar becoming stronger. Countries/ Corporations that owe a significant amount of debt will find it harder and harder to pay off that debt with interest rates going up and the dollar becoming stronger. This will lead to Countries/Corporations defaulting on their debt, Sri Lanka was only the first domino to fall. 

This gets worse, as countries start to have a hard time accessing liquidity and paying off their debt they’ll also be faced with a shortage of commodities. Their domestic currency will start to devalue vs the dollar making commodities extremely expensive relative to their domestic currency.   

I expect the Middle East/Africa to be the most impacted, considering the amount of food they import. 

You may think the United States is safe from this global mess, but mind you we import most of our stuff so it’ll be interesting to see how things play out.

1159,vwomls,An interesting perspective about political advertisements,"Right off the bat, I wish to say I more or less consider myself to be a libertarian.

Furthermore this is meant to be sort of a though-provoking discussion.

On the news, ads and commercials we quite often see politicians talking about how much good the state has done to the people. However this most of the time ends up being propaganda, as politicians and governments tend to lie a lot. 

Now, what I found terrifying is the following: the other day my 7(!) year old cousin just word for word repeated a commercial video about a fridge or something. And personally I find it  really sad that even the youngest ones can be influenced by corporations this much. In my humble opinion children should not be influenced by politcal ads nor “business commercials”.

My questions would be:

1. We can all agree that political ads should not have any effect on children whatsoever. And if you support business commercials and not the political ads, dont you think it is hypocritical to support one but condemn the other?

2. Dont you think advertisements of any sort should be regulated such that the this sort “memorizing effect” will be minimalized?


To give me personal opinion, what I heavily dislike about capitalism are the commercials. They are almost anywhere, where they are let to exist.

1161,vw5ajc,Libertarian Positions?,"My understanding of libertarianism, and own personal position, is that you are to respect that people have the right to do things that you disagree with in so far as it does not cause harm to others or violate their property rights.

It does not mean that you have to agree with all of the choices everyone makes or their lifestyles simply because they have the right to make them or live a certain way.

A hopefully non-contentious example being cocaine. One could agree you have the right to do cocaine in the privacy of your home or on someone's property who allows it, and the government shouldn't stop you. That does not mean that you have to allow someone to do cocaine on your property, and you are allowed to disdain its use yourself. Substitute cocaine for prostitution or what have you, the principal is the same.

Is this an accurate description of consensus amongst libertarians?

My other question is policing. What is the general consensus libertarian stance on it? I imagine it spans from complete anarchy (no government thus no police) to a slimmed down version of what we have today.",8795340433800,1

I'm a strong believer in (what I believe to be) the Libertarian mindset. I see values on both sides of the R & D coin, think governing decisions should be minimal in everyday living and resonate with the definition of what Libertarianism is.

Even more so believe that the US DESPERATELY needs a competitive third party. It's been so evident in the last three elections that the general US consensus is in a reach for drastic change, yet not enough change to vote confidently outside of the left and right. I'm utterly amazed as to the people that tell me they don't vote 3rd party but would but there is ""no chance"" a third party could win; YET, if enough people voted 3rd, the popular vote would really stir up the race and make things shift for actual change. At the very least, it would open the eyes to so many that there is a political shift in viewing other options outside of R & D, especially the politicians.

Hell, I talk politics and start asking questions and get people to realise they align more with Libertarianism more than anything else, yet they have a firm reluctance to vote different, which is just moronic, least to me.

My question is what is it going to actually take to get more of the masses to vote Gold (aside from massive funding) as we are the closest thing to a viable third party.

So let's imagine for a moment the 2nd amendment is being rewritten. You've been tasked with re-writing the amendment to suit the needs and concerns of a modern America (or any society, really). How do you write the amendment? Is there a way to respect the individual right to self defense while also minimizing mass casualties events and criminal gun violence? Is there a way to ensure a population's ability to defend itself from threats domestic or foreign while limiting individual gun ownership? Do you make the individual right to bear arms more explicit? How do you address the definition of arms, what weapon types are included? What barriers if any are allowed to be placed between a person and this right?

I suspect I know what most answers will look like, but I'm curious if any libertarians have thought of more creative approaches to the issue.

Original text:

Those people were criminals. They were tax cheats. They were traitors. They looked their government, the British crown, in the face and said, ‘We do not acknowledge your right to rule us at all.’ They did not say, ‘Will you please reduce this and please be nicer here?’ They said, ‘It's over.’”

""How many people celebrating across this country today actually support that kind of radical, extremist action and attitude that you can go to your own government and say, ‘We're not going to obey you anymore. We do not acknowledge your right to rule us at all ever again.’? Personally, I doubt it's very many Americans.""

“We have lots of sort of residual freedoms left over from what a bunch of radicals did a long time ago … The bad news is the spirit that allowed this country is basically dead in the vast majority of Americans. The vast majority of Americans are absolutely incapable of thinking, much less speaking, the concept, ‘You're not the boss of me.’”

“Now when we look back it's easy for us to cheer, “hooray,” for the rebels. We know how it turned out. We know they won. We know the Revolution was successful and King George got his butt kicked. So we can say, “Yay, yay, hooray.” But make no mistake when you cheer for the people who had the American Revolution, you are cheering for traitors and criminals. They broke the law. Freedom is always illegal. Let this one thing sink in if you don't hear anything else, freedom is always illegal because the people who want power over you will always say, ‘Keeping what you earn is against the law. Being armed is against the law. Determining your own future is against the law.’ How many Americans, as much as they celebrate Independence Day, are capable of even thinking those thoughts?”

“Those men believed in something called unalienable rights. That means you have a right to do something. If the law says you can't do it, you still have the right to do it. If the government says you can't do it, you still have the right to do it. Unalienable means nothing anyone in the world can do takes away your right to do that. Now they can infringe on that right, which they do on a regular basis. They can stomp on you and they can hurt you and they can punish you, but it will never be legitimate and nobody should ever bow.”

“Now some people, every once in a while, will say, ‘Well, it was really oppressive back in 1776 and we're just not quite to that point yet.’ If 2 to 3 percent taxation justified a revolution in 1776, why doesn't 50% and growing justify a revolution? If the few little excise taxes on pieces of paper and tea justified open lawlessness from these rebels that we're all celebrating, why don't the myriad of incomprehensible, unavoidable, crushing taxes … justify revolution today?”

“Your obligation is to judge right and wrong for yourselves and to act accordingly. And if somebody says, ‘No, no, no, I’m the boss. I'm in charge. I'm the authority. I lay down the law. You do this.’ You have the right to say, ‘No, I'm not going to do the wrong thing just because the law tells me to.’ And when they huff and puff and say, ‘You're nasty criminals and … horrible people that you would dare to disobey authority.’ You tell them, ‘You’re not the boss of me.’”",-3062094065886701982,1

1198,vqirjz,The pharmacy needs to be liberated from government regulation.,"As a child, I remember going to the pharmacy and actually seeing the pharmacist.  I would talk to him. He would give me a lollipop. He knew my mom and greeted her by her first name, and she knew him.

These days, we have store such as Walgreens, CVS, Rite-Aid and others. These places have ONE pharmacist on staff, and a bunch of other staff that helps fill prescriptions and ring you out.  In the last 2 decades, I have never seen a pharmacist.  I mean, I see them in the back with a lab coat on, but I've never talked to them.

Well, in my state (PA), it is illegal for the pharmacy to sell or dispense medicine without a pharmacist BEING PRESENT. He doesn't need to be the one to actually fill your medicine, or ring your out.  He just needs to be there.

So, yesterday, I drive to the pharmacy to pick up my medicine, and I can't, because the pharmacist called out sick. The whole pharmacy is shut down. They're not filling prescription medicine. They're not selling prescription medicine.  I'm SOL. Thank God, I am not a Type 1 diabetic who's out of insulin.

I've had this problem before where I show up at the store and the pharmacy is closed early, because the pharmacist had to go home early. I was there once, where the pharmacist had go leave in an emergency, so they just had to shut the pharmacy down and tell all the people in line that they're SOL.

I fail to see the point of a government regulation that requires a pharmacist be present to sell you a medication that the pharmacist already filled.

While we're at it, let's get the Sudafed back on pharmacy retail shelves, so you don't need a pharmacist to hand it to you.  I have allergies and get bad sinus headaches.  I've driven 30-45 to the nearest 24 hour pharmacy to buy a box of Sudafed while I had a pounding sinus headache because my kids took the last two tablets.

**It's a shortened parliamentary week.**

MPs head back to their constituencies on Wednesday evening for a mini recess. It's not a long one - they'll be back next Monday.

**The agenda is looking pretty safe before then.**

Absent is anything controversial like the Online Safety Bill.

Instead, we've got a couple of ten minute rule motions and social housing reforms in response to the Grenfell Tower tragedy which reaches the Commons after going through its Lords stages. (Typically, government bills that start in the Lords are the less contentious ones.)

**And Labour has an opposition day debate on Tuesday.**

This is where they get to set the agenda. Still TBC what they want to discuss, but it's likely either to be a current issue they want to bash the government on, or something more thematic like the cost of living.

### MONDAY 7 NOVEMBER

**Social Housing (Regulation) Bill - 2nd reading**  
*Applies to: England, Wales, Scotland (part), Northern Ireland (Part)*  
Reforms social housing regulation following the Grenfell Tower tragedy. Changes include ""Ofsted-style"" inspections for underperforming landlords, requiring social housing landlords to test electrical installations, and introducing a Freedom of Information-style process for tenants to request information from landlords. Started in the Lords. More information [here](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/insight/insight/social-housing-regulation-bill-10-key-changes-for-the-sector-76102).

### TUESDAY 8 NOVEMBER

**Employee Share Ownership (Reform) Bill**  
Introduces a new employee share ownership scheme with preferential access for lower income workers. Ten minute rule motion presented by George Howarth.

1225,ynnh4t,"In this climate of debating immigration, can we talk about children?","Let's start with some basic conservative assumptions that we rely on the growth and productivity of the workforce in order to fund our current spending/ aging population, and that the gap left by the native work force is filled by immigration so neither party wants to curtail this. Ok? Got it?

I want to move this conversation forward to talk about what I contentious issue which is the birth rate of settled, British born, middle class in this country. Why are we not having enough kids to maintain our replacement level?

Without going all nutcase replacement theory, there are certain groups that will have multiple children; but the more educated, career focused and wealthier households are the less children we will have. And that needs to change if we actually want to get a hold on immigration.


As a young woman, Tory, but also ambitious individual, I don't think we should blame educated women as the demons here- I would love to have multiple children, but I've narrowed it down to three factors that make it less desirable for me, university educated, has a decent job and stable relationship to consider having more than 2 children, compared to a immigrant or working class population where the mother (or both parties) doesn't work. (I'm an immigrant myself but a very middle class one with two highly skilled professional parents) 


1/ The obvious: prohibitive cost of childcare vs career progression: women who don't want to take a massive career break at a time in their lives where big promotions and officerships takes place. Having multiple children in succession would be career suicide, but if you're on the cusp of the free childcare bracket then all your allowance gets taken away and you get burnt both ends. People on lower salaries or in communities where women are expected to stop working after children don't experience this squeeze as much as they break even if they don't work vs. sacrificing a much higher salary.


2/Average quality of schooling in this country is awful, so either you have to plan and see how many children you can afford to privately educate, or the cost of buying a family home in a decent grammar/comprehensive catchment area. My education as an only child in a relatively LCOL city in this country cost my parents £100,000+ over my adolescence. London schools are more expensive, London postcodes even more so. Very little is being done to improve the quality of primary and secondary education in this country and instead we are seeing lots of academy/ faith school/ schools where there's basically only single demographic pupils due to the socio economics of the area. 


3/ House prices factor in/almost necessitate having double income households... So say you've done all the right things to counteract the above, paid for your 'good comprehensive school catchment' postcode, found a place with decent nurseries nearby, overmortgaged yourself with your partner, salary sacrificed to keep your childcare allowance... Will you ever be able to take time off to spend with your babies in their earliest years? If you have a slightly more complicated pregnancy, a child with special needs etc. There's a choice that will have to be made about returning to the workforce or a parent taking a pay cut. 



One of my ideas to solve to this would be cut child benefits to remove the incentive to 'just have children' and replace it with free childcare for all. This encourages more people who participate in the workforce to have children without sacrificing work. I've been informed by my boyfriend that this would be an instant vote loser on par with Liz Truss, but I'm trying to think long-term here.

1229,yo34jn,Starting to wonder how i can stand for social conservatism in these times,"I've been supporting social conservatism (neo-victorian myself) for many years now, but since March 2020 it's gone down the hill, i have seen more anti-JRM and anti-tory propaganda then i have in my entire life, my family converted to leftism over night, i remember a time when me and my brother were equal as we both stood for brexit and traditional values, not anymore, i lost him to the left wing, he claims to be right wing but in reality is only right leaning now, now he's anti-brexit, anti-tory, is a doom merchant, blasts out left wing political rap songs which contain lyrics that are anti-tory, anti-religious, one of which compares JRM to hitler, it's the most blatant far left stuff i've seen/heard, recently he said 'where's guy fawkes when we need him?' whenever my brother or my parents have something to say about or my views and beliefs, it's always negative.

&#x200B;

Then boris got fired because of his parties (because screw lockdowns) and that resulted in JRM quitting his job, now he's a backbencher, and he'll probably lose his seat, with the amount of far left propaganda i'm seeing i fear JRM will lose his life if anything, this shouldn't be the world we're living in, we need peace, all i hear is 'tories out next election'

&#x200B;

It's an intoxicating combination, because of all of this i find it hard to stand for my views and beliefs, there's no other neo-victorian MPs, i feel like it's the end of the line for us, that the far left will get in, abolish the monarchy and begin the left wing revolution which i fear so deeply, it will end in us losing our identity, brittania will die a painful death.

&#x200B;

So how can i stand for social conservatism in these times? i will appreciate it.

Nationalising energy companies won't change the fact that Russia still holds the cards when it comes to natural gas in Europe, that there's still a high demand for this commodity and that prices will still be high no matter private or public sector.

1265,yjmx84,Have the tories deliberately underfunded the NHS,"I work in the NHS.

I hear a lot of talk from my colleagues as well as the public as to how the Tories have deliberately underfunded the NHS in order to expand privatisation and eventually get rid of healthcare that is free at the point of delivery.

Wait times in the NHS from primary care to secondary cafe are currently abysmal for anything that is not a 2 week wait. I myself have experienced ordering urgent scans for patients to be done within the next 4 weeks only to be told that the wait is 3 months minimum (this was last year). Now I’m told by colleague such a scan would take a year. Patients are waiting hours (10+) to be seen in A&E. 2 ww targets for cancer are being missed.

I wasn’t working in the noughties but I am told that the NHS ran much better then, staff were well paid with higher morale and so retention was better, wait times were lower etc but since austerity everything has gone down hill.

Now I have never voted conservative, and I am not a labour voter either. I am not a die hard NHS fan but neither am I completely against it. I just want a health service that works.

I am aware there are some in Tory circles who would like to be rid of the NHS. But I struggle to believe that the current state of the NHS is due to deliberate underfunding because why would anyone do that surely? I know COVID has exacerbated things but things weren’t that great in 2019 either. 

Would we be in a similar state now had Labour been in charge during the 2010s or has all of this been a part of the big bad Tories?

EDIT:

My gut suspicion is that this situation is due to poor retention of staff, necessary austerity given the public finances in 2010 were honestly terrible (as opposed to cutting services for the hell of it) and the realities of an ageing population. And the fact that the NHS may not have the best funding model for our current populations needs.",-5788197708768870828,1

**This was supposed to be the week we got the government’s fiscal plan.**

But with the arrival of a new prime minister, Jeremy Hunt’s financial package has been delayed until 17 November. Expect big cuts and tax rises. The figure being talked about is £50 billion.

**Instead, there’s plenty of lawmaking to be done.**

One government bill making its Commons debut would create a publicly-owned infrastructure bank to invest in projects that tackle the climate emergency or address regional inequality.

**And reshuffles have created a number of select committee chair vacancies.**

Health, Treasury, Education, and Transport are all up for grabs. Select committee chair positions are divided between the parties, and all four of these have to be Tories.

So far, Steve Brine and Anne Marie Morris have been nominated for health, and John Baron and Harriett Baldwin for Treasury.

### MONDAY 31 OCTOBER

**Genetic Technology (Precision Breeding) Bill - report stage and 3rd reading**  
Allows the sale of gene-edited food. Potential mooted uses are to crops more drought-resilient or resistant to diseases. Gene editing differs from genetically modifying in that it's a small, controlled tweak to a living organism’s existing DNA rather than the introduction of a new, foreign gene. Both are de-facto banned in the EU so this is a major post-Brexit divergence from EU law.

**Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill - consideration of Lords amendments**  
Introduces regulation to make smart devices (like smart TVs and speakers) more secure against cyber attacks. Aims to speed up the rollout of mobile, full-fibre and gigabit-capable networks across the UK.

### TUESDAY 1 NOVEMBER

**Internet Access (Children Eligible for Free School Meals) Bill**  
Requires the government to ensure that all children eligible for free school meals have a broadband connection and facilities to access the internet at home. Ten minute rule motion presented by Siobhain McDonagh.

**UK Infrastructure Bank Bill - 2nd reading**  
Completes the setup of the UK Infrastructure Bank, a state-owned but operationally independent bank that invests in projects to tackle climate change and support regional economic growth. Gives the bank the power to lend directly to local authorities and the Northern Ireland Executive. Started in the Lords.

### WEDNESDAY 2 NOVEMBER

**Microplastic Filters (Washing Machines) Bill**  
Requires manufacturers to fit microplastic-catching filters to new domestic and commercial washing machines, among other things. Ten minute rule motion presented by Alberto Costa.

**Parliamentary business is overshadowed again this week.**

There's the small issue of who our next prime minister will be. It's (thankfully) a quick process, so we'll find out this week. But that creates a strange situation where ministers answering questions in the Commons may not be in post next week.

**But some major lawmaking is still set to happen.**

Probably most notably is the government bill to scrap all EU law that isn't incorporated into UK law by the end of next year. It's a huge endeavour and the implications will be far reaching.

**Friday brings private members' bills.**

As ever, most won't be heard before 2.30pm comes round. Last week MPs managed three bills before running out of time and adjourning debate on a fourth.

## WEDNESDAY 26 OCTOBER

**Consumer Telephone Service Standards Bill**Introduces maximum waiting times for customers who contact utility providers by phone, with penalties for companies that don't comply. Ten minute rule motion presented by Robert Halfon.

**Identity and Language (Northern Ireland) Bill - committee stage, report stage, and 3rd reading**Gives the Irish language official recognition in Northern Ireland, and requires an Irish Language Commissioner to promote its use by public authorities.

1410,ybb1pq,The different factions within the Conservative party,"As you're no doubt aware, the parliamentary party has been ripping itself apart. We are in the midst of the second leadership election in a year which will deliver the fourth PM in four years, and the party's polling is at a record low. I believe the events of the past 6 years (brexit, covid, partygate & the economic panic caused by the mini budget) have inflamed division between the factions of the party.

What are these factions? You'll likely have a different answer, but I think my answer paints an accurate picture of the present divisions within the Conservative party. Starting off, with the first two factions, there's the Old Right often called the Wets, who tend to be more moderate and more open to compromise than the other factions. Economically, the Old Right are generally supportive of free market policies but also the most open to state intervention. Then there are the Populists, they're typically more ideological, less willing to compromise and broadly eurosceptic. Economically, the populists are also generally pro free market but also supportive of state intervention in the economy in service to ideological goals.

Moving on to the other two, Neoconservatives are more ideological than the Old Right but more willing to compromise than the Populists. Neoconservatives also tend to be more in favour of international institutions such as the EU and are strong proponents of the free market, being the least willing to intervene in the economy. Finally, the Libertarians, while having their own party also have a presence within the Conservative party. Libertarians typically are pro small state and most opposed to state intervention in the economy and are often eurosceptic.

As of right now, I would guess that the Populists are the largest faction within the conservative party, though not the majority. The Old Right & the NeoCons are aligned with each other against the Populists while the Libertarians are an unreliable junior partner to either side. At this point it might be helpful for me to name noteworthy figures who I think best represent these factions.

A figure that represents the Old Right in my opinion would be Rishi Sunak. For the Populists it would be Boris Johnson. For the Neoconservatives, John Major (Thatcher would also be representative though she became more eurosceptic towards the end of her premiership). Lastly, a prominent figure for the Libertarians would be Steve Baker.

As previously stated, you will most likely come to a different conclusion than me. Even so, I hope you can understand what  I'm trying to convey based on my own observations of the events of the last few years. Thank you for reading.",-180224649117570614,1

I feel the MP's that keep promoting Sunak, from likes of Liam Fox and Dominic Raab, to William Hague have been non-stop promoting him just simply aren't going to convince me, and ramming it down my throat isn't going to change that.

Sunak in the least bit desirable in my opinion to be running the show or be part of a Cabinet again. He has never had a single financial struggle in his life. His wife's father is a billionaire, a wife who regularly committed tax evasion, even if it was legal. Sunak has only worked for the likes of Goldman Sachs and hedge funds. He has no loyally to the UK, essentially spending most his work life in the US.

And said his self has said he has never had working class friends. He is a silver spoon. Being Chancellor, his record is nothing but mediocre. He is just one of the many Bankers you can find in Canary Wharf (Not attacking that, just don't think it's the right type to represent and manage a whole country). To me, Thatcher was someone who represented the UK well, as she had worked up to her position and wasn't given every opportunity from the get go.

My feelings for the party reflect those MP's who support Sunak. The party has no ambition, stuck in a bubble of themselves, a party that takes no risks, their policies and so, their actions are essentially Blair 2.0, the party that decks out the same hand of cards for more than a decade.

Aren't they tired of only ever being voted on ""Better than the other guy""?

If you look at the latest number of supporters for both, Sunak has crossed the 100 mark, and Johnson seems to be getting pretty close to it. Mordaunt can perhaps still make it, but it looks unlikely.

The Conservative party membership are likely to vote for Johnson rather than Sunak in the final vote. This opens up many questions:

- How will Sunak supporters respond to Johnson winning and becoming PM again?

- Would Johnson give any roles to Sunak or his supporters in his new cabinet/government?

- Will any ministers resign at the prospect of Johnson becoming PM?

- How will the different factions of the party respond?

- How will Johnson deal with the current Parliamentary investigation into his conduct during his previous term?

- If he ends up facing a by-election and losing in Uxbridge, how will that affect his role as PM?

I reckon Boris backers declared early because:
(i) They hate Rishi/ Penny so the decision was easy.
(ii) To apply pressure on other mp’s to side with them.

Whereas, Rishi’s backers have been more tactical, holding back to see where the herd moves before making their decision.

I doubt Boris will make it to 100, but even if he marginally does, Rishi can just offload his excess backers to Penny so that both Penny and Rishi beat Boris in mp support and thus make the final 2.

Unless Boris gets the support of more than 1/3 of the mp’s (119 total), I cannot see a way in which Boris wins.",1443217869505827756,1

1455,y9obtv,Who would even serve in a Rishi Sunak cabinet?,"With Rishi Sunak apparently now the bookie's favourite to succeed the ill-fated Liz Truss as PM, anyone can probably imagine who could serve in his potential cabinet if Boris doesn't get a second stint in No. 10. Here are my brief thoughts for a Rishi cabinet - if his goal was to unite the party, complete with a fresh blend of loyalists, and the broader party:

* **Dominic Raab** \- Deputy Prime Minister and Levelling Up Secretary
* **Jeremy Hunt** \- Chancellor
* **Penny Mordaunt** \- Foreign Secretary
* **Grant Shapps** \- Home Secretary

Additionally, I envisioned Therese Coffey, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Ranil Jayawardena, and some Truss loyalists leaving their posts, with other Truss cabinet members like James Cleverly, Nadhim Zahawi, and Simon Clarke being moved to other cabinet posts (others like Ben Wallace could remain in post).

I think there is a broad view, amongst people who are similar to me both in their political views and knowledge of politics in general, that post-2010 Conservative governments are conservative. It's been quite eye opening (as a neutral-ish/left of centre voter) to learn, from being on this sub, that post-2010 is actually quite far from what traditional conservative voters actually want. More surprisingly, is that a lot of the shit that post-2010 governments have done is just as despicable to voters like me and you guys in equal measure, just not necessarily for the same reasons.

I think in a way this reinforces something I've been trying to pay more attention to, which is that when it comes to what is really important to us as a society, and to living a good life, so much of what we all want is the same. It's just coated in other superficial bullshit that is used by some politicians to enact their own agendas or those of other interested parties.

Sorry bit of a waffle post, but want to make my thoughts known. I am aware that a lot of this shit was happening before 2010, I'm just not as knowledgeable about it. I know that many view New Labour and post-2010 Tories as near-identical. I can't comment on that but what I'm saying isn't incompatible with that view, I don't think. I'm just describing what I've observed here more than anything.

1540,y5dan0,Natural party of government?,"As per my flair, I am a curious neutral. 

One thing I see repeated time and time again is this belief that the Tories need to go into opposition for “a few years” to sort themselves out, clear the deadwood so that they can then have an inevitable coronation and a triumphant return.

I find this curious. There seems to be an underlying assumption that as long as they’re basically competent, they are de facto the natural Governing party. I accept this has been the case in modern British history. 

It strikes me that the UK would be in a much better position if political parties of all persuasions considered being the ruling party to be something to aspire to, to dream of and to work desperately hard for, with a much larger degree of creativity than the current state of affairs and underlying assumptions, perhaps born of Etonian levels of arrogance (with the current Government), that assume power is deserved and expected as the norm. 

As I said, I’m a curious neutral, (I grew up in Finchley in the 1980s, many of you know from this who my local MP was!) 

I came to this sub with a cynical approach to PM Johnson some months ago but a desire to listen, learn and understand. The recent s*itshows have, as with most sane people, left me horrified and appalled. The repeated assumptions that a few years in opposition to clear things up a bit before a return to normal service strikes me as dangerous thinking. 

Without a much deeper understanding of the damage they have created and the deep trauma felt by many millions (barely begun yet, witness what will happen with cost of living,mortgages and deep cuts to spending all to come) it could be that the Conservative and Unionist Party of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is finished as a political force. Assuming a few years of opposition while Starmer et al fail to deal with the poisoned chalice will do is not, to me eyes, going to cut it.

The obvious letter of the law answer is that the public don’t elect a leader but a party. But surely if the party changes leader, and direction/personality twice before the standard term of the government is up, there is a strong case to be made that the current form of the party is not what people voted for?

mine:

* nationalise food banks, which are currently effectively a tax big supermarkets collect from consumers, giving out 3 nutritionally balanced meals a day. food is sourced fresh from British suppliers and there is no means test. replaces whatever replaced CAP and also removes the pie in the sky about universal basic income. of the two big welfare issues this deals with one. 

* open asylum application processing centres abroad in conjunction with 3rd countries, including Calais. pay for dedicated accommodation as refugees currently receive in those states, whilst maintaining humane treatment according to UN convention from the centres themselves. this would presume the French allowing us to stop traffickers at source and ship them to our 3rd country centres, including but not necessarily Calais. the French in return get an unmanaged safety issue brought under outsourced control.

* my preliminary economic policy is get rid of half Quart, followed by a wartime boom in the MIC as we declare our intent to gather a NATO Coalition of the Willing to engage in the ground war in Eastern Europe to a) avoid it becoming a multi year war b) end energy uncertainty c) avoid China stepping into a geopolitical power vacuum d) bring the green agenda back to the fore of global politics. in return, particularly from our Eastern European partners we would expect support for an end to the EU's disruptive restrictions on the UK internal market and partial credit for any successful military outcome in terms of global prices.

People's needs change with time. Social Housing, by very definition, is for those ""most in need"". But if their needs change, why doesn't their entitlement? For instance, we have a mass of older parents in the UK currently occupying social housing because at the time it was allocated they had a family to raise. Those children have now flown the nest (sometimes multiple generations ago) yet they rattle around in 3 or 4 bedroom houses. Why? 

My own Nan is implicit in this. She lives in a 3 bed semi detached house near a primary school. The council have stumped the cash to install a stairlift, completely adapt the bathroom for grabrails etc, all the while this poor woman can't even clean said house, it's too much work. There's a driveway and two large gardens, none of which she can maintain. I've spoken to her about moving to assisted living accommodation which she's open to, but has no understanding of how to ask about it through the council.

Then it comes to winter. Media circus makes a big deal about how the elderly will suffer more / be worse off every winter. So we subsidise their bills, just as we are subsidising the very property they live in. It's expensive to heat a massive house, it's absolutely insane to heat a massive house for a single occupant?

I'm prompted to write this because just now the council houses in my street are being decked out with new double glazing in time for winter. That means the drug addict next door but one can at least remain warm when he's next beating up his wife. 

Why is there no policy to means test every 5, 10 years? It's a fallacy. All the while there's a housing crisis we have things back-to-front. Those young families are living in new-build rabbit hutch estates without enough parking, in tiny homes which are super efficient and cost effective to heat. Then we have old single people occupying massive family homes which they cannot heat or maintain. It's madness, why is it seemingly so obvious but nothing is being done about it?",-179572606664056589,1

**What a start to autumn it's been.**

Summer recess ended up running for longer than planned because ordinary business was suspended following the death of the Queen.

That pretty much took us up to the conference recess period, which is why this is only the second newsletter you've had since July.

**Tory unity will really be tested now.**

Liz Truss has taken a pasting in the last few weeks, including from several members of her own party. But are her Tory critics all talk? Now Parliament is in session and votes are happening, we'll find out just how rebellious they can be.

**But Project Truss continues this week.**

She was elected on a promise to cut taxes, and she's continuing to stand by that.

One of the more eye-catching bills would reverse the planned 1.25 percentage-point National Insurance hike brought in under Johnson. It was introduced to pay for social care. Truss says she'll find the money from general taxation instead.

He seems incredibly polite, intelligent, decent, well-intentioned and genuine, quite the opposite of what people accuse Conservatives of being. His grasp of policy and economics is on point, he's a sympathetic character and he embodies old school traditional values of protection, conservation and prudence.

An academic, a soldier, a diplomat, a professor of human rights and policy, an experienced minister in four departmens, someone who literally walks the talk such as travelled through Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, India and Nepal for two years on foot, writing a memoir on the experience which became both critically acclaimed, an award winner, and a best seller.  

Having been both Labour and Conservative in the past, he could understand both sides and attract voters from across the isle. You'd only have to listen to him speak, and it's clear that he isn't repeating rehearsed replies or winging some BS reply.

What on Earth happened to make him lose to Boris Johnson? If you voted in this election, my question is simply ""Why not Rory Stewart?"" So far, he seems far more competent than Johnson and Truss.",-1035339708903805100,1

The party of deregulation and tax cuts, if this is not the party of this, then who is? 

If this isn’t the party of Brexit then who is? All of the issues with the EU was due to sovereignty and bureaucracy as a result of the regulation they bought on us so should we not deregulate as we planned to do so with our new freedoms? Or are we to regulate and tax higher than Europe?

1695,xto1lh,Should new hereditary peerages and baronetcies be created?,"As you are aware, the creation of new hereditary titles has dwindled since the Life Peerage act.

While, except for the Life Peerage Act of 1958 itself, most destructive ""reforms"" were made by Leftists themselves - largely ceasing the creation of hereditary titles in 1965 and emasculating the House of Lords in 1999 - Conservatives have failed to reverse them.

While the untitled nobility is regularly replenished (as every person who has a coat of arms is a ""gentleman"" and thus of the lowest level of nobility, meaning that Garter and Lord Lyon de facto perform ennoblements) every year, the hereditary peerage and the baronetage are now basically closed categories, and unless a political change occurs, it will not be possible to newly acquire a hereditary title in Britain regardless of one's achievements, even if they are sustained in the family (something that is accelereted by a hereditary title).

As you are also aware, life peerages have led to an inflation in peerages and cronyism.

What would you think about repealing the Life Peerage act and putting the creation of new titles away from the hands of the Prime Minister into a ""Council of Nobility"" as in Belgium? Of course, this would mean less creations, maybe 2 or 3 per year, if not less, but they will at least be hereditary and underline that nobility is not political but stands above politics.

Also, rather than changing inheritance laws, the problem of titles dying out when there are no male heirs can be solved by recreating some of the extinct peerages, maybe with a Scottish-style remainder that allows for a daughter to inherit it if there are no sons.

The House of Lords would certainly shrink as Life Peers begin dying out, but the 1999 emasculation of the House can simply be reversed, once again admitting all hereditary peers into it.

In addition, people who complain about hereditary seats have no reason to complain against baronetcies, as they don't give any privileges whatsoever.

A Life Peerage is, except in name, identical to senate seats and decorations that can be given out in republics. Nobiliary distinctions should be distinct from republican distinctions by being hereditary.

I think that it would be a very good gesture if King Charles, when the Coronation Honours List is submitted, creates at least one new hereditary peer or baronet.",8687434285159257948,1

1708,xsfx9z,the philosophical tragedy of the left,"



 The Italian left lost the elections.  This fits into a wider rise of right-wing governments across Europe (eg Sweden).  In my opinion, the crisis of the European left is due to the fact that its own ideology, now far from the ambitions of defense of the working classes, contains a series of unsolvable contradictions, all linked to the management of immigration and globalization:
 - the modern European left is in favor of immigration.  While there are some economic benefits to immigration, the negative consequences that a high rate of immigration entails are paid by economically weaker classes: lower wages, greater competition and therefore difficulties in receiving social aid, health systems and public education more under stress, higher levels of crime . As a result the poorer social classes qre less likely to vote for the left
 - similarly, the modern European left supports immigration from countries with very conservative cultures. At the same time it supports LGBT rights, women's rights, the right to atheism and blasphemy ... it is clear that this position is in contradiction with itself and it is only a matter of time before this becomes extremely evident.  (eg the murder of two homosexuals in Oslo this summer, antisemitic attacks,...).  In the long run, especially in countries where there are liberal and non-religious right-wing alternatives in favor of LGBT rights, some minorities will no longer vote to  left.
 - there is a tendency in a part of the left, especially of an Anglo-Saxon matrix, to interpret negatively in an ahistorical and uncritical way everything related to Western history and culture (eg. Destroy the statues in the UK, accusing  Queen Elizabeth of colonialism ..) without applying the same treatment to other cultures.  Asking your population to despise their own history and culture will obviously lead to a large chunk of your constituency turning against you.

 In summary, unless the left resolves these internal contradictions, its ideology is likely to collapse completely on itself in the next few years.

What makes the tax cuts so bad? Because I feel that reaction is almost ridiculous and I don't really see any good argument other than ""Conservatives bad"" ""Labour will win"". The fall out seems more to do with market reactions, than is the policy itself actually being about is it good or bad.

Surely making the UK more attractive tax wise would be considered a positive, especially when the UK is trying to attract more foreign interest and be more competitive internationally.

Is there something I'm missing? Is it more to do with how the tax cuts are being implemented as opposed to tax cuts themselves? As it seems any form of change has some negative result, from which I can't really understand why, as I would feel the UK is becoming more competitive.

What has caused to having so much negativity about supporting the idea of lower taxes?

UK taxes are the highest they've ever been.

Really hoping for non party politics answers, but rather about the policy if any party presented it.

It was to stop the markets being shocked and prepare the ground.

However, within a week the £ will be back above where it was before, with a government that said it's committed to growth. When other economies are hunkering down for recession, such a positive attitude to investors really could be the right thing to do. However, it won't be quick and it won't be easy. If it's the right thing to do, it will show by the time of the next GE and the polls of today are irrelevant. 

Also if not this, then what? Carrying on moving further left with a bigger state and higher tax on business. Aside the chaos, that budget was exactly what I know businesses wanted to hear. We have a media who love drama and character assassinations, that's simply how it is and how it would be for Labour too. Basing long term economic policy on the whims of the 24 hour media is how you get in a mess (Boris).

They are pretty f\*cked. There are also Quantitative Easing losses to be factored in. The Bank of England has been buying lots of UK treasury bonds. These are all worth way less because of higher interest rates. Losses on these at 6% interest rate is around £200bn. Bank of England losses are underwritten by the treasury. So £200bn for that plus £200bn for electricity/gas plus £50bn for tax cuts.

£450bn of unfunded commitments.

£/$ parity is actually quite likely in the short term.

I do think it will level out but not for a while (assuming Truss stays in power). Not a certainty at this stage.

*(I then challenged his figures).*

ok, £450 bn is a very glass almost empty number

More likely £300bn. The trouble is the number of buyers you need to find for UK gilts in a short space of time. Demand isn't there. US interest rates are high too. The dollar looks way safer. So £ getting hit as we have to sell so many gilts (add to those old gilts that the Bank of England are trying to sell - reversing Quantitative Easing). Makes £ weak for foreseeable.

UK economy also looks way weaker than US economy (energy prices, weaker UK consumer, lower productivity) so our ability to pay back debt is OK but not as good as other economies/currencies.

Long way of saying we are f\*\*ked for a few years. Think the next six months will be close to the bottom of markets as most of this s\*it is already priced in.",3397608541053488540,1

(1) It seems Thatcher had genuine supporters welcoming her into Downing St. whereas Tony Blair had some pre-arranged almost Stalinist-like theatrics for the camera. As with most things today, smoke and mirrors.

(2) The BBC felt that they ought to 'change' the tone of their coverage to better 'support' the left-wing government, and the so-called new 'consensus' & give them a lift or morale boost. It show how easy its for a purported balanced organisation to go awry and fall for the spin and narrative.

&#x200B;

*I quote the relevant bit below:*

&#x200B;

>When the scale of Tony Blair’s 1997 election victory became clear, there was an unsettling change of mood at the BBC. I first noticed it during the election results programme, which I was anchoring.  
>  
>On the morning of his victory, Blair decided to emulate Margaret Thatcher’s triumphant walk up Downing Street to the door of Number 10 in 1979. Back then, Downing Street had been open to the public. Anyone could stroll up and take a photo outside the famous door. The crowd that had cheered for Thatcher nearly 20 years earlier were a random collection of supporters, members of the public and tourists. In the years since, wrought iron gates had been erected to close the street off to the public.   
>  
>On television, although the scene looked like a replica of Thatcher’s triumph, a spontaneous burst of public enthusiasm for the newly elected Blair, the welcoming crowd was mainly composed of Labour Party supporters who had been issued with passes to allow them in. A minor but significant difference, I thought. I pointed it out in commentary and the voice of my editor came through my earpiece: “Steady on, David. This is a great moment.”  
>  
>Worse was to follow. In the days after the election there was serious discussion about whether the tone of our political interviewing should change to reflect the change of mood in the country. If even The Sun had endorsed Blair, it was argued, perhaps there was a national consensus around the new administration and the BBC should reflect it. The editor of Newsnight wrote to his team:  
>  
>The model of five years of Tory coverage must be thrown away. The template of split, disunity, Europe and chaos may one day apply, but it doesn’t yet and we mustn’t behave as if it does. Labour has a huge mandate and our job should not be to quarrel with the purpose of policy but to question its implementation.  
>  
>It was an unsettling argument, fortunately soon abandoned in favour of our proper stance that all administrations, however popular or unpopular, are treated the same.

The no. 1 issue over the last 8 weeks has been the cost of living crisis and energy bills. You'd think therefore that Tory members should be able to choose their leader on the basis of their policies on the cost of living crisis.

Liz Truss has spent those 8 weeks saying ""I'm not going to predict the future"" and ""We'll announce something in the Autumn"", which was a bit annoying but you think 'fair enough, they need to think this through and come up with the best policy with the autumn data in their hands'.

Except no, she hasn't done this. Literally 2 days after the leadership election finishes she announces her policy. Disgusting. That fully thought-out policy did not appear overnight. She has clearly had that for a while. Absolutely duplicitous and disgusting behaviour. She's withheld her ideas to avoid scrutiny, to avoid debate, the debate we've been supposed to be having for the last 8 weeks. 

As a conservative (as in an actual one) I have to say that I really disliked Boris Johnson as prime minister because he never governed as a conservative. I now have a very bad feeling about Liz Truss. The fact of the matter is that she's already betrayed Tory members once, literally within a day of getting the job.

Stop immigration. Again not half arsing it or talking about it, just do it. Shut the door and you're not coming in unless we actually need you AND you can support yourself.

**We're hours away from finding out who our next minister is.**

When I last wrote, the Tory leadership race was just getting started. This week will be all about seeing who Boris Johnson's successor appoints to their cabinet, and what their immediate action on the cost of living crisis looks like.

**The government bills keep coming, though.**

Data and financial services are the two big areas seeing a post-Brexit regulatory shake-up. In practice, this means fewer online cookie alerts and more control for the Treasury over how the City conducts itself.

**And Friday brings private members' bills.**

We start with Dan Jarvis's bid to extend protection from redundancy for mothers who have recently returned to the workplace. There'll probably be time to hear one or two more bills before the end of the day.

1860,x2k0f5,The demise of the Baby Boomers will change Britain forever,"The demise of the Baby Boomers will change Britain forever

Children of Baby Boomers are due to inherit £1.2 trillion from their parents, making society more unequal than ever before

Right now it’s open season on the Baby Boomers. Left-wing millennials seem to blame the postwar generation – most of whom are now pensioners – for everything from wealth inequality to the shortage of affordable housing. Indignantly they quote claims that the average pensioner now has a higher income than the average worker, that pensioners control around 80 per cent of this country’s private wealth, and that one in five pensioners is a millionaire. In their fury, however, these millennials are forgetting a small but significant fact.

Which is that Baby Boomers are not immortal.

As a result, over the next 20-30 years this country is going to experience a phenomenon that experts are calling “the Great Wealth Transfer”. According to one estimate, the children of the Baby Boomers are due to inherit an incredible £1.2 trillion from their parents.

It may seem an unlikely figure. After all, lots of pensioners don’t have all that much in the bank. But a great many of them do have a house. A house they bought decades ago, when the average property went for a fiver and a packet of crisps, but has since rocketed in value to mind-boggling heights. When they die, therefore, their children will be able to stick it on the market, and rake in the handsome proceeds. Obviously there’s inheritance tax, capital gains and so on. But there should still be a fair whack left over. And since the Boomers are by far the richest generation in history, their children will receive by far the biggest inheritance in history.

This windfall will change our society forever, for several reasons – but not all of them good. First, because the windfall won’t be equal. Some millennials will become rich overnight, while those who were born to poorer parents will get nothing. This is bound to make our society even more bitter, resentful and divided than it is now. Because instead of attacking Boomers, millennials will be attacking each other. “How can it be fair that you inherit a fortune, and I’m still penniless?” they’ll scream. “You did nothing to earn that money. Why should you get to buy yourself some big fancy house, or retire early?”

The Great Wealth Transfer may also have a dramatic effect on our politics. Put it like this. Once they inherit wealth and property, today’s Left-wing millennials may suddenly decide they aren’t so keen on socialism after all. Finally they may detect one or two upsides to capitalism, now that they have some capital of their own.

And so, to their horror, they may find themselves afflicted by a creeping temptation to vote Conservative. And not only that. Once they’ve used their Boomer windfall to buy a nice house, they may start to reconsider their constant demands for mass house-building. Out of nowhere, they may discover a deep and heartfelt passion for protecting our precious green spaces, and for preventing property developers from ruining our beautiful countryside (or at least, from ruining the view from their own houses). In short: today’s Yimbys may become tomorrow’s Nimbys.

Of course, it’s possible that the Great Wealth Transfer won’t be quite as great as experts imagine. For one thing, much of the Boomers’ wealth may ultimately get swallowed up by the costs of their care. And future Labour governments may increase inheritance tax. In which case, millennials won’t inherit very much after all.

Then again, millennials are overwhelmingly Labour voters. And if a Labour government threatens to slash their inheritance, they may threaten to stop being Labour voters. So, just as Conservative governments have repeatedly shrunk from the wrath of the Boomers, Labour governments may shrink from the wrath of the millennials.

Whatever happens, it’s bound to be bumpy. And it should confound at least one ageist prejudice.  

Many of today’s angry young Left-wingers tell themselves that once these Tory-voting Boomers are out of the way, they’ll finally be able to build a fair, just and equal society. But in reality, the demise of the Boomers may make society more unequal than ever.",-2788155799814105274,1
1861,x29sud,Am I the only one who is extremely deflated after Kemi wasnt moved forward ?,It just seems crazy to me that the Tory party had an opportunity to revitalise and energise their base and bring a new leader to the front someone who would be capable of also bringing in new votes. I'd class myself as a right leaning centrist swing voter and I just cannot see myself voting for Tories in the next election with either Truss or Sunak at the helm.

1863,x1uswg,The Great British Depression,"15 years ago, £1.00 equalled US$2.02. 15 years years ago, our economic activity matched a trend line set for the past 50 years. We grew at an average rate of 2.7%, we're now way below that trend on 1.7%, and this is getting even worse. 15 years ago, our GDP per capita was higher than the US's. 15 years ago, our debt to GDP ratio was 41%, not the 100-ish% we have today. 15 years ago, real wages did not stagnate. 15 years ago, we had a legitimate reason to save money as the rates weren't piss poor (5.75%). Then there is inflation, clearly far worse than in 2007. Yet, we do currently have high employment. Well, these jobs are poor quality as our worker productivity is a shambles, and if these jobs were so great, we'd have the economic activity / real wages to match. Yes, the 2008 crisis hit hard, but surely after 15 years, we should have recovered, but instead, we're still in the same quicksand, slowly sinking. We've been in a depression, but no one really talks about it or will rarely admit it.

So what is the cure for this? Is it Liz Truss's economic plans? Do they inspire you to think that she can halt this decline and bring about prosperity? Or perhaps you feel she has simply put on a Tories' Greatest Hits album and is hoping that that'll do the job? I was pleased to hear she said they should be a party focusing on economic growth, but to me, it was far too little, too late. Unless they go hard on the real potential drivers of economic growth (cost-effective energy, SMEs, getting liquidity into the system for SMEs, trade, manufacturing advanced goods, making sure advanced and big British companies stay British and aren't gutted by hedge funds or by anti-competitive big tech firms, put big capital behind big British firms that actually make things, fintech, blockchain, long-term economic planning etc), I feel we might just end up in the gutter. I hope their solution isn't just to cut taxes, borrow more, QE to infinity, sell off more of our silverware (if we have any left), and send the pound into oblivion.

EDIT: Apologies, the average GDP growth between 1955 and 2008 is around 2.5%. This is based on a Bank of England report. From 1992 to 2008 the growth was 2.93%. So, the point still stands that we are well below trend. ",5880140607783102764,1

1880,wztxyl,The social mood is souring,"The backdrop: After unprecedented government spending from covid as well as now severe supply constraints on oil/gas we now have very, very visible inflation and sky high energy bills.

Central banks must now crash the economy to deal with said inflation by hiking interest rates and tightening their balance sheets leading to a recession which we're now starting to see the early stages of. 

The present: Truss doesn't seem to be all that popular amongst the general population (as far as I'm aware, happy to be corrected though) and as the governing party during this crisis they're going to take a lot of flak for this simply due to being the governing party and people blaming (incorrectly for the most part) various other factors for the state of the economy right now.

I don't know what the solution is but the Conservative party has a real fight ahead of them for the next general election, as living standards decline I am noticing socialist and borderline communist policies gaining popularity whilst fiscal responsibility is shunned. Again I don't know what the solution is here but the public mood isn't a good one, when this recession hits at the same time as high inflation it's going to get ugly - not to mention the average person soon to be struggling to paying for the energy bills in the winter.

Even more government spending across the board? Entrenched inflation. No support? People will have a very hard time and extreme views will become more pronounced, a high price for fixing inflation which may even not be guaranteed due to the oil/gas situation.

This party really must find a charismatic leader by the time of the next general election, macro economic forces are just too strong and the public will clamour for government support which only prolongs the pain of inflation. In my view the govt must provide *some* support, so as to be seen as doing anything at all but it must be fiscally responsible. We are paying the price for the furlough scheme + the consequences of the war in Ukraine.

They do not have the luxury of a price cap, and they'll have impossible overheads because of this (I've seen some pubs quoted £60k for the year for gas/leccy). They also don't have the capital to hold out, especially after lockdown. Banks are/will be unwilling to provide credit as well due to the level of risk. To add to this, there will be a significant demand reduction. You might think, ""but hey, it isn't like Amazon closing down,"" so it won't be of much consequence, so let me give you some figures. 

 

* total employment in SMEs was 16.3 million (61% of the total), whilst turnover was estimated at £2.3 trillion (52%). These are 2021 figures.

They are the primary economic drivers of the UK, and we're about to kill many of them. Anyone with a cursory economic understanding will know this will have a massive contagion effect. The dominoes will fall, leaving us a far more destitute country with an increasingly devalued currency.  

I am no Keynes fan, but here is a quote of his that suits:

""Thus inflation is unjust and deflation is inexpedient. Of the two perhaps deflation is, if we rule out exaggerated inflations such as that of Germany, the worse; because it is worse, in an impoverished world, to provoke unemployment than to disappoint the rentier. But it is necessary that we should weigh one evil against the other. It is easier to agree that both are evils to be shunned. ""

We have both evils through stagflation. Unfortunately, the worst is yet to come!

&#x200B;

So how is the government to respond to this? Why aren't they seeking to protect the primary economic drivers? Does anyone have anything optimistic to chase away my gloom?

Being that the NHS was implemented by a government in 1940's that was hugely Pro-State intervention, from an ideological standpoint, the NHS is an institute of big state, state intervention, state run, state funded, which generally goes against the fundamentals of small state, low tax, personal responsibility.

I really don't see what people defend, the NHS itself is largely incredibly inefficient and people just think throwing money at it will just solve things. Its budget is already £176.4B.

Yet I see very little support for a system like Singapore, which has a balance of low spend, high quality, high efficiency, high access, by utilising both the private and public sector together. For a country that had an NHS, that was a 1-1 copy of our NHS, that got independence from the UK and then abolished almost straight simultaneously after gaining independence from The UK, and had no where near the budget the UK has for healthcare, has over taken The UK in nearly every avenue in healthcare with less money, less resources and a much weaker economy, and regularly exceeds the UK in nearly every area with regard to healthcare, and has done so for quite a while.

A good video explains the Singapore system and why it works: https://youtu.be/sKjHvpiHk3s

What and why do people defend a system that was designed to be not be adaptable or fundamentally open to change, by a big state, ineffective government that did nothing but lay the foundations to make the UK economically weaker and less free

Edit: From what it seems, people haven’t actually looked at how Singapore runs their healthcare, utilising private doesn’t equal USA system. I mean cmon, you don’t see the NHS having an R&D department for manufacturing medicines, even toilet paper or their facilities, they utilise companies, thus the private sector, think along those lines.

There's also the brexit party/Reform UK, then in 2020 had the creation of the Reclaim party & the Heritage party.

Do these parties influence the conservatives to embrace more staunchly right wing/populist policies or do they just help Labour by vote splitting?

1940,wsdr77,A Skeptical view of Research in Bias in AI and Machine Learning,"There is a entire academic and consultancy industry which looks for bias in both human and machine decision-making and which hopes to monitor and control decisions in all areas of life in the name of fairness. I believe that we should concentrate on ensuring that decisions (typically derived from predictions) are taken as accurately as possible, and be skeptical of claims of unfairness using criteria different from those of accuracy.

In simpler times, we were assured that the various protected characteristics were completely unconnected with any other characteristics of humanity, and that it was racist or sexist to believe otherwise. In this situation, non-discrimination is easy; shield the decision maker from knowledge of the protected characteristics and descrimination becomes impossible. Any complaint that this mechanism leads to unfairness is in fact an admission that, given sufficiently large amounts of data, differences can be detected between the different protected groups, and between them and the remainder of the population.

The assumption of real differences between different groups also means that the many different definitions of fairness proposed by academics are genuinely different, and we cannot hope for a mathematician to come along and reassure us that, in chasing one definition of fairness, we would in fact be fulfilling all of the others. Since all are different, it is impossible for all of them to coincide with maximum accuracy, and unlikely that any will. An early paper is ""Inherent Trade-Offs in the Fair Determination of Risk Score"" by Kleinberg, Mullainathan, and Raghaven. This considers three very natural definitions of fairness. It shows that no two of them can coincide unless either the prediction mechanism never makes a mistake, or else there are no real differences between the groups - in which case simply ignoring the protected characteristic guarantees fairness. Table 1 in ""A survey on bias and fairness in machine learning"" by Mehrabi, Morstatter, Saxena, Lerman, and Galstyan lists 10 different classes of fairness criteria.

The existence of multiple different definitions of fairness makes it possible for anybody with a political goal to choose whichever definition of fairness makes their point most strongly. The influence of differences between groups also means that we should be very careful about applying ideas from cultures where their group structures are different to ours: a definition which is practical somewhere else may be nonsensical here. One example of this is the United States, where there is a large and readily identifiable group of people who can trace their links to ancestors who suffered from slavery, and some claims that they are still suffering from its effects. In the UK we may be able to find a few descendants of slave-owners, but we have many fewer descendants of slaves than the US.

I believe that we should avoid politically motivated definitions of fairness by shielding the decision process from protected and irrelevant characteristics, and then using procedures designed to make as accurate a prediction as possible. One reason to select accuracy as our single measure is that there may be real costs in departing from accuracy; this means less productive employees, either immediately after selection for job selection, or on employment after training, when selecting for educational opportunities.

There is, however, a genuine question to answer: if a young candidate has, in practice, had fewer opportunities to learn, would they do better than their qualifications might predict when solving real life problems? The section ""Inventor's Careers: The Potential for Lost Einsteins"" (P 60) of the Paper ""Who becomes an inventor in America? The importance of Exposure to Innovation"" by Bell, Chetty, Jaravel, Petkova, and Reenen says ""No"", at least for the particular case of American inventors. Alas for rags to riches stories, somebody who has missed out in early life due to their background is likely to be at a permanent disadvantage relative to their better qualified peers from more privileged backgrounds, and will not leap ahead of them once freed of their early restrictions. 

From the point of view of accurate selection of staff, including e.g. Doctors and Pilots, the best bet is likely to be to ignore their background and select by qualifications and aptitude tests, and not to attempt to correct for early disadvantage by so-called positive discrimination, or by choosing a definition of fairness that amounts to the same thing.",-4635790421628734605,1

1943,wrn19h,"The UK does not exist in a vacuum. (My views on the real impact of Brexit, and doing your own research)","Dear r/tories,

I'm writing this letter to remind my fellow subscribers that while the UK may be a cluster of islands, we are not as separate from Europe (and the rest of the world) as some would have you believe. If you have read any of my other comments recently you may recognise some of what I say here. I apologise in advance for my unoriginality.

&#x200B;

**A quick bit about Brexit**

First I'd like to address the negative reports among the newspapers and social media. The UK voted to leave the EU and this has obviously had its consequences - years of parliamentary deadlock being one example.  Since our departure from the EU, many companies have moved offices off-shore. Indeed, it's hard to find an objective look at this amidst the reams of articles bemoaning the claimed costs of Brexit. If you look a little closer, however, you will see that this street is, in fact, [two-way](https://www.business4beginners.co.uk/uk-remain-financial-capital-after-brexit/) as many hundreds of businesses move offices into the UK.

There have been numerous other positive side-effects of Brexit, including the reshoring of supply chains. According to a study by Make UK, [1/3 of UK manufacturers](https://www.makeuk.org/insights/publications/budget-2021-submission) were working on reshoring their supply chains as of 2021.

On top of this, the UK's economic growth has (almost) consistently outperformed our peers in the EU, namely France and Germany. It may have escaped your notice (and I wouldn't blame you as nobody is reporting it, bizarrely) but the [UK economy has overtaken France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)) again.  If you want to know the truth about the economic performance of the United Kingdom, compared to its peers, ***do not read the news.*** Once you commit to avoiding the headlines and clickbait, finding the truth could not be easier, just use a reputable source for economic data and do the research yourself. Failing that, check out these graphs for the [UK](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/gdp-growth-annual), [France](https://tradingeconomics.com/france/gdp-growth-annual) and [Germany](https://tradingeconomics.com/germany/gdp-growth-annual) and see for yourself. If Brexit truly is so terrible, why aren't we trailing behind in these metrics?

&#x200B;

**The issues behind our current economic troubles**

Some of you may have noticed that in February 24th, a war broke out in Ukraine. The consequences of this war have been felt across the world, especially in Europe which has been so dependent on Russian gas and oil.  The cost of fuel has the knock-on effect of [driving up prices across all sectors](https://news.sky.com/story/cost-of-living-inflation-shows-fuel-costs-have-infiltrated-every-sector-of-our-carbon-economy-12589152).

The pandemic is still causing problems across the world, especially China. While to many people here in the UK, the pandemic is little more than an excuse for politicians to explain away economic troubles, the fact is that the pandemic is still causing problems. China's ""Zero Covid"" policy means that there are still lockdowns taking place in the country where many of our imported goods are made. Their lockdowns are so severe and draconian that they even [lock down shops with people still in them](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-62547503). This is causing problems with supply chains which reinforces what I said before about UK firms looking to reshore.

There has also been a great deal of concern about China's expansionist goals. A Chinese invasion of Taiwan could drag the US and NATO into a conflict with one of our biggest suppliers of manufactured goods.

All of the above are contributing to inflation - however it would be a mistake to pretend that the UK is the only victim of this. [Germany](https://tradingeconomics.com/germany/inflation-cpi), France, [Spain](https://tradingeconomics.com/spain/inflation-cpi), [Poland](https://tradingeconomics.com/poland/inflation-cpi), even [Sweden](https://tradingeconomics.com/sweden/inflation-cpi) (which doesn't use the Euro) are also suffering from incredibly high levels of inflation brought on by the disruption to fuel and supply.

&#x200B;

**A final word about research**

I would just like to explain my views on research to the good people of this sub. I would always recommend that you do your own research to corroborate whatever you might read in the news. Many people believe that by reading articles from media with opposing views (ie Mail vs Guardian) counts as research, but I disagree. As almost every article is trying to push an agenda, and there are no rules which compel them to be impartial, it is almost impossible to ascertain which article is true, or whether even the premise on which they are based true.

When you are conducting research, if you simply search Google (or any search engine), it will lead you astray. The search engines are manipulative in their own right, and often twist search terms to provide a result which the advertisers want you to see. As I mentioned above, trying to find the truth is incredibly difficult when there is so much bias in media, and unfortunately, search engines are paid to funnel you into those ad-ridden clickbait nightmares that are online newspapers.

That is why I believe that it is always best to stick to the raw data. Using impartial data sources such as [tradingeconomics.com](https://tradingeconomics.com), or looking at the numbers (not the headlines or conclusions - they are often just as sensationalist as the news articles) from ONS, IMF, UN or OECD studies.

Most of all, I would urge  you to put no stock in predictions. They are worse than useless, and nearly always wrong.

&#x200B;

Your humble servant,

VincoClavis

That's fine though, I'm not here to debate, because it turns out that I have some surprising common ground with quite a few long term Conservative voters/members.

That being that it seems that even here, there doesn't seem to be many people who are actually all that happy with the current version of the Conservative Party, and/or are disappointed with all of the options for our next PM. On top of that, at uni, I met loads of people who are inevitably going to be Conservative front-benchers at some point in the future, but a disconcerting number of them actually revealed that they had actually voted Lib-Dem most recently because they couldn't bring themselves to vote for the Conservative party in its current form. I've been lurking for a while, but I'm not much closer to actually understanding the average conservative voter.

As a disgruntled ex-Labour voter, I can definitely understand that feeling in general, but increasingly I have no idea what conservative voters actually believe and how you think. I'm not asking you to try persuade me to your side, because the ideological gap between us is so huge that even if I do understand your side of things, I'll probably still vehemently disagree (though not on this thread, coming here as a guest and starting arguments would just be rude and unproductive), I'm just curious as to your side.

A lot of people seem to dislike Boris Johnson, but your reasons may be quite different to mine. In the run up to the fall of Boris, it seemed like lots of Conservative voters wanted Boris gone, but also that there weren't really any viable replacements. Now, it seems that many of you are equally disappointed in the options that are on the table, but also unsurprised by how bad they are. If both Sunak and Truss are bad options to you, tell me what kind of person you'd prefer the next PM to be, what kind of policies would you like them to champion? And if, since 2010, you have found yourself increasingly opposed to the actions of the Conservative government whilst still considering yourself a Conservative (that sad ""this does not feel like my party"" feeling), what led you there and what would you prefer they have done?

I'm most interested in perspectives from people who are unhappy with the current state of affairs because that's the side that's hardest for me to understand, but if you have specific examples of government policies since 2010 that you have been significantly in favour of, I'd be interested to hear those too – often debates between people on opposite ends of the political spectrum feels like two people trying to debunk each other, which doesn't lead to much productice discussion, so I'm trying to disrupt that.

I hope this is okay to post here. I saw the pinned post about the recent influx of bad faith actors and I am very much not wanting to contribute to that, so I am going to keep my own views out of this, I just want to hear a different side without the defensiveness that comes from adversarial framing of conversation.",5502937352409943036,1

1994,wl1ke3,Our choice in leadership isn't a choice at all.,"  ‘If we are not for sound money, then, what is the point of being a Conservative?’ It was then that there became no real choice in this leadership election. Counterbalancing the bizarre point, which Mr Sunak has stuck to throughout the race, with Ms Truss and her descent into blatant Trump-esque populism, it looks to me like we are faced with an election for UKIP, not the Conservatives.

I have been following the hustings since they started, reading the articles and watching the debates, hoping beyond hope to see a deviation from the script, and the Sunak and Truss I hope to see, break free of the spin and the pollsters’ machinations and get us back to the Conservative principles this party should be all about.

Instead, what we have seen as being performative ‘poll chasing’. Mr Sunak takes to the stage with a little ‘sprint’ up the stairs, a wave to his t-shirted supporters, and a short video espousing his love of family, country, and patriotism. Presumably, someone else told him the ‘sound money’ point wouldn’t be enough on its own.

He follows through by reminding people – his mum was a chemist.

Then it is on talking about what a bad state we are in; presumably, he hopes nobody remembers that he was in Government for many of the disastrous policies that caused us to be in this state in the first place. All-in-all it comes across as a little too slick, a little too ‘spin-ey’, and just a little too rehearsed. 

Typically Ms Truss is up next, and her campaign certainly seems to be able to list with the wind and tide a little more quickly than Mr Sunak. However, when Sunak says a whole lot of nothing, listing would be tricky indeed. 

There have been more flip-flops in the Truss camp than you could find on most Spanish beeches, and yet her supports bay her on, crowning her the champion of Brexit (and ignoring her position as a Remainer) and, with odd affection giving her the title of 'a pound shop thatcher’, which Ms Truss seems to embrace.

However, Ms Truss, who before know most people only knew for *that* cheese speech, has begun to move closer and closer to an almost ironic populist speaker. She blames the media for everything, talks about ‘the woke mob’ when she runs out of points and seems to fall back on dogmatic whistles, more at home in a Young Conservative dinner party than on the stage of a leadership contest.

Yet again, we have a leadership race that seems to be avoiding talking about the broad intellectual argument as to why we are Conservative in the first place. Instead, we rest on soundbites about sound money, small boats, and the ‘woke left’. We have not spoken at all about our shared inheritance, peace, freedom, law, public spirit, civility, property, family life – we have not talked at all about what we need to *conserve­ –* and how long they take to build, and how fleeting their destruction would be.

We have instead been presented with a leadership race that seeks to talk about polling more than principle, forcing us to choose between a man who abetted the problems we face and wishes we would forget and a woman who changes her mind on a whim and speaks more like a right-wing populist than a conservative.

2004,wk7xsy,Moving Utilities into Public Ownership,"I'm not remotely the sort to advocate public ownership of anything. Never have.

I've just finished paying British Gas a Bill that was 2 weeks old after they lost my account (my previous supplier went under and BG lost my account for months). 

They put the charges on quietly, they didn't show on any type of bill. They were ""added to the meter"" (I'm on a direct debit not a pay as you go meter or anything). The call centre staff either didn't understand or were under instructions to keep the charges as quiet as possible.and avoid talking about it at all cost. I went through 3 advisors before I got to the bottom of it. 

They're basically charging 3X the previous value on a product that hasn't yet gone up that amount in price and loving life as they seemingly come up with new ways to trap ordinary middle class families in debt cycles. The price is the same everywhere, the only way they get guarantee a retained customer is to put them into debt so they can refuse new suppliers. 

Might sound like a conspiracy theory but either way with Centricas profits recently I feel like they've failed the ""should we let private industry loose on a commodity like our gas and electricity supply"" test. 

Never voted anything but Tory. Not sure how this sentiment will go down here. 

Tl;dr British Gas in particular have fallen below an ethical benchmark and I believe the whole industry should be brought into public ownership.",-1209637664278212141,1

2012,wjd8mt,Subreddit Announcement Re: Conservative Members and Recent Influx of Users,"Recently the mod team has noticed since Boris resignation there has been a spike of users that have come into the subreddit who are unfortunately not been acting in good faith. This has upset the balance of users in the sub that had existed previously, which has resulted in a severely reduced and drowning out of conservatives voices and opinions which has long contributed to the subreddit.

As a result, we have decided to trial the return of the “Verified Conservative” user flair. The goal is ensure there is a free space for conservatives to talk among themselves without bad faith should they wish.

**What is this?**

Users with a “Verified Conservative” flair will grant you the ability to comment on posts that have the flair “Verified Conservatives Only”. Users with other post flairs will not be able to comment on such posts, and will be automatically removed.

This flair is reserved exclusively for Conservatives (Big and small c). Mods reserve the right to assign such a flair to users. If you are a leftist, please do not apply.

**How do I get it?**

Once you are an active member in this community with a history of posting , please modmail us applying for such a flair. We will look at things such as your comment history in this subreddit and others to vet your applications.

Note: Moderators reserve the right to revoke the flair should we feel that you have strayed from the goals and spirit of this discussion. As always, subreddit rules also apply in post flairs as well.

Please keep in mind that this is a trial. We are humans, and mistakes will happen as we try to tweak it. Once the leadership election is over, the mod team will decide if it’s worth it to continue.

A big thanks to the folks at r/Conservative for helping us with the automodding!",6795448801146454651,1

2027,wibh25,A plea to vote for Rishi Sunak from a party member,"There is only one candidate who has a hope of fixing this economic issue, and it’s the one who helped cause it by having to compensate for a disaster lockdown policy.

The line ‘the BOE’s job to control inflation’ is dangerous. 
Right now there is too much money in the system, causing a devaluation in the £. 
There are 2 primary ways to reduce the money supply… increasing interest rates and taxing money out of the system. We live in MMT world now, taxes aren’t there pay for services, it’s to regulate the money supply.

Let’s evaluate the two plans and their consequences;

Rishi - Use tax policy to catch this money as it rinses through the system, increase interest rates at a manageable rate with a lower ceiling to protect the housing market.
When it’s under control, stimulate the economy by reducing taxes and interest rates.
The winners: homeowners, renters, every day people

Liz - Reduce taxes. She isn’t going to reduce income tax but an amount that’ll level out interest rate rises. She’ll reverse the national insurance hike and call it a tax cut for people. Corporation tax will be cut in a bit to grow the economy and leave inflation to the BOE.
The BOE will have to put up interest rates…. Faster and higher to remove that extra money from the economy. The default rate will skyrocket… good people who bought properties will see their mortgage payments quadruple. 
Companies will take those tax savings and give them to employees and it’ll soften the blow I hear you say? Well that’s not guaranteed. If they don’t, the housing market collapses. If they do, it’ll fuel inflation and cause even more interest rates rises.
This will give starmer the next election - which I would bet on it happening sooner than the date in the FTPA.
Also ignore Nicola Sturgeon!? Sounds nice… but by saying this she’s just alienated millions of Scottish voters at a time where there is a fragile relationship.
Winners: Large corps and shareholders with a lower tax bill. Kier Starmer. Nicola Sturgeon.

I urge my fellow members - show restraint. We have an important responsibility here to choose a candidate who will carefully navigate this shit storm, and that candidate is Rishi Sunak.

There is an elephant in the room… Boris.

Let’s be clear, Boris has been in the firing line for some time and I do applaud his resilience. However given the situation, It would be irresponsible if we didn’t have possible leadership candidates ready and prepared to take his place. Whilst pulling the trigger can be seen as disloyal, it was time and having prepared candidates prepared to take the reigns was a sensible and responsible thing to do.
Now whilst I like Boris - let’s not be any under illusion, the man is driven by ego and we should ask ourselves - would Boris sacrifice the Tory party for his own ego?",-5025464820289047484,1

Do you think only competing as Team GB would foster a better sense of Britishness, bringing long term benefits of cohesion? If so, how should we approach it? I know it it would screw up things like the 6 Nations Rugby tournament - but all that does is encourage ""us vs them"" attitudes which erodes national unity.

It dawned on me that he must therefore have an incredibly good reason to do so. When I heard him mentioning interest rates from borrowing, I came to the realisation he may be anticipating a crash, whereby we would be more secure had we borrowed less. As Chancellor, he may have had better information than us, and with the US in recession and China looking increasingly jittery he may genuinely have the interests of the country at heart.

Theresa May would have been a great PM, but Brexit brought her down. The speech she made outside no' 10 when she was elected was brilliant. She talked about education, NHS, brexit, uniting people and something a lot of people don't talk about, mental health.

The conservatives introduced Universal Credit (poorly exicuted but a lot easier to deal with), national living wage, record funding for the NHS (still not enough), ending the recession, highest employment and brexit.

Personally i’m not enamoured with Truss but i do have faith in a few politicians judgement like Marcus Fysh and he endorses Liz so i hope there is something in that and this is the sort of positive sentiment we need to embrace as a country.

The culture secretary, who has led the landmark legislation to regulate social media companies, said the leadership frontrunner would “certainly” pick up the bill where it left off before parliament finished for the summer recess if she were elected prime minister on September 5.

Dorries also accused the Labour Party of putting thousands of children and vulnerable youngsters in danger by calling a “sinister” and “nonsensical” confidence vote in the prime minister this month. 

On Wednesday the NSPCC, Britain’s biggest children’s charity, warned that more than 3,500 children a month would be abused online while the bill is delayed. The debate and vote on the confidence motion meant that the Online Safety Bill ran out of time in the House of Commons, although the government had control of business in the chamber and could have found time elsewhere.

It had only hours to go before it would have passed all of its Commons stages but the confidence vote has delayed it until after the summer recess.

The delay has raised fears that the bill could collapse because of Truss’s previous concerns that its requirement for technology companies to remove harmful content from their social media platforms could impede freedom of speech.

Last week a representative for her campaign said that if Truss won the Conservative Party leadership race, she would revise the legislation to ensure it did not damage freedom of speech.

Truss would tweak it as “we need to be careful to not damage freedom of speech”, a representative for her campaign said. However, speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Dorries said: “Certainly, under Liz Truss that bill will continue. What people don’t understand is in section 19, particularly under sub-section two, it contains protections for freedom of speech that don’t exist right now.

“That was equally as important as protections for children and young people to keep them safe online.

“I know that cynical, sinister manipulative act pulled by Labour in the last few days has left many parents, grandparents, children’s charities and campaigners across the country bitterly disappointed.”

The culture secretary added: “That was personally a day of agony for me because the Labour Party called a nonsensical no-confidence vote in the prime minister, which meant that that bill is now stalled, which meant that children and vulnerable young people will spend so much longer without the online protections that they need to be in place.”",-2788155799814105274,1

######49th Congressional District

**Brian Maryott**(R) is looking to unseat a Democrat incumbent. Polls at the end of October are showing anywhere from toss up to leans R. This seat has historically been red,but the last few cycles has been blue (like the trend in the rest of Orange County/San Diego areas).

##**Senate**

**Mark Meuser**(R)  Constitutional Attorney. His opponent is the incumbent Alex Padilla, who is one of the long time California ""architects of failure.""


##**Ballot Measures**

California is special because of the ballot measures citizens get to vote on. Often they’re worded in strange, double-negative speak to confuse people to vote for more spending. 

**Proposition 1** (amending state constitution to add abortion) - NO

**Proposition 26** (more tribal gambling) - NO - this is a sneaky carve out for one specific tribe to the detriment of others. 

**Proposition 27** (online gambling off tribal lands)  - Personal choice 

**Proposition 28** (more money for arts, education, music, etc) - NO

**Proposition 30** (raise in taxes to try and fight pollution and wildfires) - NO 

**Proposition 31** (referendum to end sales of flavored tobacco) - NO

######Proposal 3 - Right to Abortion and Other Reproductive Procedures (Trans).

**VOTE NO** - Voting no prevents the State Constitution from being amended to enumerate a right to ""reproductive freedom"" - aka abortion. On closer look reproductive health also covers trans surgery and other hormone treatment WITHOUT parental consent/knowledge. 

#**State Supreme Court**

2 seats are up for election for Michigan supreme court, the two conservatives of the bunch are: 

**Brian Zahra** -currently sitting on the court. During his tenure so far on the state supreme court, he has ruled and dissented conservatively on the issue of abortion and same-sex unions. 

**Paul Hudson** is currently an appellate lawyer in private practice. He has a judicial philosophy that a judge judges and that judge do not create public policy. 

##**Ballot Proposals**

######Prop 3 

**Vote no** - This codifies abortion, even without parental consent, for reasons stretching as far as ""mental health"". 

######Proposal 2

**Vote no** - allowing for ID free voting, and allows for in person voting before election day.

######Proposal 1

**Vote no** - prop would increases term limits to 12 years in each the house and the senate, compared to 12 years total, and mandates any state political official to release their financial information.

Some politicians see the danger incoming but they don't do anything against it. Hamburg, second biggest German city (and the city I moved to), just allowed China to buy up nearly 30% of one of the harbors terminal. Yes, in the media, it was critically discussed and some people spoke out against it. But the government didn't interfere. The vote opinion pool hasn't changed.

2286,ypaxhj,Just read this in my critical analysis textbook,"> And though critical race theory started  out as a critique of constitutional law—that is, federal law, which is based on the Constitution and which the laws of individual states are not supposed to violate—it has spread to almost every discipline, including the humanities. As we’ll see, critical race theory concerns itself with every topic that is relevant to race. In addition to investigating such obvious issues as the kind of oppression described in the passage quoted above, critical race theory examines the ways in which details of our everyday lives are related to race, though we may not realize it, and studies the complex beliefs that underlie what seem to be our simple, commonplace assumptions about race in order to show us where and how racism still thrives in its “undercover” existence.

We've all been lied to. I literally had a long argument with a guy a year or so ago and he continually insisted ""it's just a legal theory bro"". But that's not what they actually say, just how they shut down discussion and pushback. This textbook similarly helped prove me right (to myself anyways) about connections between postmodernism and Marxism as well.",5046364527840824784,1

Of course, the implication of these article are that these ""threats"" exist in elections where Democrats lose (2016, 2022), but not where Democrats win (2018, 2020)

From Politico today:

[6 election security threats to watch for on Election Day ](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/07/6-election-security-threats-to-watch-for-on-election-day-00065277)

> The 2020 presidential election was rife with allegations of voting machine hacks that were later debunked. Yet there are real risks that hackers could tunnel into voting equipment and other election infrastructure to try to undermine Tuesday’s vote.

> Lies and conspiracy theories about the security of election systems are what most worry election supervisors and federal cybersecurity and intelligence officials, because those falsehoods can inflame mistrust that discourages people from voting and provoke anger that spurs people to threaten violence against election administrators.

> Hackers have one relatively low-tech tool for knocking campaigns off balance and disrupting voters’ access to reliable election information: forcing websites to crash using automated tools that simulate massive floods of people visiting those sites.

From the New York Ties yesterday

[Russia Reactivates Its Trolls and Bots Ahead of Tuesday’s Midterms](https://archive.ph/2n0Wd)

> It is part of what the group and other researchers have identified as a new, though more narrowly targeted, Russian effort ahead of Tuesday’s midterm elections. The goal, as before, is to stoke anger among conservative voters and to undermine trust in the American electoral system. This time, it also appears intended to undermine the Biden administration’s extensive military assistance to Ukraine.",-6086318570386643415,1

According to Pres. Joe Biden, we are the the midst of the most robust economic recovery in history. And our economy is the strongest it's ever been.

What a difference 2 yrs can make.

National Debt today - $31.1trillion (per CNN - [https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/04/economy/us-national-debt-31-trillion/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/04/economy/us-national-debt-31-trillion/index.html) )

National Debt 2 yrs ago - $17.1 trillion

Inflation rate today - 8.3%

Inflation rate 2 yrs ago - 1.17%

Gasoline today - $3.79

2 yrs ago - $2.09 (nat'l avg)

Diesel today - $5.31

2 yrs ago - $2.43 (nat'l avg)

Mortgage Interest rate today - 6.33%

2 yrs ago - 2.65%

3rd qtr GDP Growth today - 2.6%

2 yrs ago - 33%

Dow Average today - 32,403.22

2 yrs ago - 29,467.90

And all this is the result of the most robust economy in history??????? This is what economic recovery looks like???

Russia has invaded Ukraine and initiated a war that's lasted nearly a year at this point.

North Korea is saber-rattling and firing rockets towards both South Korea and Japan, threatening both nations.

China is becoming increasingly belligerent towards Taiwan.

Rather than approve domestic drilling permits and pipelines, the President has resorted to begging Saudi Arabia to export more oil, and is giving serious consideration to importing oil from the sadistic and brutal regime in Venezuala.

So with all this in mind, remember to ask yourself these questions when you go in that voting booth tomorrow:

Are you better off than you were 2 yrs ago??? Is the country better off that it was 2 yrs ago???",-6009318300926824839,1

Proposal 1 would double how long state representative can serve in the House chamber, and extends the term limit of a state senator by 4 years.

Proposal 2 extends early voting to 9 days, which makes it challenging to hold a secure election. Additionally, makes it an option to show voter ID when we vote, among other things. This would ultimately make us highly vulnerable to voter fraud.

Proposal 3 is so extreme it’s not even funny. This would allow abortion up to birth, and it waives parental consent. (i.e; a 10-year old child can receive an abortion, without parental consent) additionally, it gives minors the ability to effectuate their own decisions on sterilization, and gender transition (i.e; a 10-year old child could go through gender transition therapy, without discussing with their parents first)

Being intrigued I looked through her episodes and the latest one was ""2nd ammendment: why our right to bear arms shall not be infringed!"" Being even more intrigued I decided to listen to it.

She pretty much prefaced by saying, and I'm paraphrasing, ""Her opinion on the second ammendment has evolved over time"" and then went on to give a fairly constitutionalist POV on the second ammendment and then had a interview with Steve Scalise and his experience with the congressional baseball shooting. 

It was a pretty interesting podcast and was even more interesting her opinion on the 2nd ammendment has changed. Considering people change opinion on the 2nd ammendment happens so it's not completely out of the realm of possibility she's being genuine. 

That all being said with her leaving the Democratic party and endorsing a whole host of republican candidates am I crazy to think that she is prepping for something else down the road? I'm not trying to shill for her by any means and I'm still skeptical of her intentions. I just find the shift absolutely fascinating and was wondering what the subs thoughts on all this is?",-5012091848875274654,1

My family are long-time republicans but recently my mom and sister have changed and said they are going to vote for democrats instead. My dad is still voting republican but he doesn't really care about politics. My mom said she started feeling different after the 2020 election when people started talking about the election being stolen. She was still going to vote republican because we are strongly pro-life but she started watching the January 6th committee and said it was her ""last straw.""

I think she is being brain washed by the media and my little sister just goes along with whatever she says. I have tried telling them the election was stolen but my sister just keeps sending me clips from the hearings or footage from Jan 6th. This is my last ditch effort to try to convince them before Tuesday. My mom said she will still vote red at the local level but she can't vote for anyone who ""denies the election"" and is ""against democracy."" We are in Georgia and she says all of our federal and state candidates ""support the big lie.""",6102794220809542591,1

3010,ypa5j4,Theories as to why Gen Z is so authoritarian,"As someone who is now 22 and part of the older segment of Gen Z, I seem to have noticed that many of my fellow Gen Zs seem to have some serious authoritarian tendencies. Below I will explain some of the things that I think have contributed to this phenomenon:

1. People who are part of Gen Z are more likely to have grown up with helicopter and/or overprotective parents. As a result on this type of parenting being the norm for Gen Z, people from Gen Z are more likely to lacking in independent living skills and tend to be more sheltered or at least grow up more sheltered. They pretty much grow up in a bubble and when that bubble is burst, they ask that their parents or the government come take care of them because becoming independent at an older age can be very stressful and anxiety inducing. Also, when somebody lacks freedom and independence when they are young, they tend to have less appreciation for these things.
2. Gen Z gets exposed to a lot of doom and gloom and that a lot of aspects of society are in crisis. When people view a situation as extreme, they are more likely to demand more extreme solutions to solve these real or perceived extreme problems. The type of activism we see with the 'world is going to end in 5 years because of climate change' activists is a great example of this phenomenon. 
3. It isn't unusual for people to think that the things that they grew up with a normal and acceptable. Many people who are part of Gen Z can not remember a world without cancel culture and hence view it as normal which resulted in them viewing it as acceptable. Many people who are part of Gen Z are witnessing the dogmatic behaviour of their parents on culture war issues and they are absorbing it like sponges. 
4. Social media has created an environment where people are under pressure to conform to standards that are unreasonable and unrealistic. Constant censorship has pushed people into echo chambers and since so many people self censor, extreme stances that aren't that popular in real life appear to be more popular than they actually are. Gen Z spends a lot of time on social media and it is hard not to be affected. Social media can act like an enforcement tool for conformity which is more associated authoritarian mindsets and many people on social media including much of Gen Z are competing to be the biggest conformists for the likes and instant gratification from their peers.
5. Many people who are part of Gen Z don't realise that changing people's minds and world isn't something that can usually be done over night. When people don't instantly change their minds because very few people change their entire worldview over night, they get triggered and frustrated and think that the only solution is to force their worldview on the other person.
6. Rebellion is currently medicalised. Many of those kids who would have become our generations rebels or part of our counter culture are sent to a psychologist, labeled 'mentally ill' and gaslighted and drugged into submission to ensure conformity. 
7. Lockdowns and other covid measures stunted the development of Gen Z in many ways including contributing to many of the issues above. Many young people had their maturity stunted at the age they were at the beginning of 2020 and the lockdowns severely limited the ability of Gen Z to grow, experience things and gain independence since they were all locked inside all day with little stimulation, lots of social media and little way to gain realistic life experience. Many people around my age were in university when 2020 came around. University is meant to be a time when young people grow, mature, accelerate their independence and get real life experience. Lockdowns significant derailed this and result in many university students experiencing what could be best described as an authoritarian regime simulation with universities excreting insane control over every aspect of a university students life during this period.",-1857854020068938730,1

Your grandparents worked for The Company (one transfered from another company), and for several generations behind them, most of your ancestors worked for The Company.  So from the time you were born you were an Employee.

The Company realizes that people need to eat, so every 4 hours it makes pizza for the office.  The employees vote on which type of pizza they want and whichever type gets the majority of votes is made for everyone.

There are currently two major groups of pizza enthusiasts at The Company, the Carnivores, who believe that meat is the only valid set of toppings, and the Vegitarians, would believe that only plants and mushrooms are valid toppings.  The Supreme party occasionally gets a few percent of the vote, but never close to the majority.

You are free to bring your own lunch from home, which most people do, but you must pay for your fair share of the pizza.  It can either be automatically deducted from your bank account, or you can manually figure out how much you owe and bill yourself, you still have to pay.  If you refuse to pay for the pizza and other Company benefits, you will be put in a cage in the basement, and the other employees will be OK with this because refusing to pay makes you a bad employee and may mean you hate The Company.",-1945032458583374678,1

I feel tired today, unmotivated. I just want to sit around and goof off. I don't want to trim my body hair. Its a lot of work, particularly trimming my ass hair. The bro shaver sure helps with the back but none of this is easy. I just don't feel like doing it!

But guess what?

I'm going to go trim my ass, arms, chest, loins and shave my back anyway because it needs to be done. 

A man does what needs to be done regardless of how you feel about doing it.

Personally I think it’s an interesting way to go about it and it seems like it has had some positive outcomes (I.e. the White House deleting a misinformed tweet). 

I like the idea of the community having access to provide context with sources instead of an all powerful “fact-checking” moderator. 

What are your thoughts?

Since Elon is now the ruler of Twitter (finally) he has been pushing the idea of community fact checking and not an all powerful moderator. You probably saw the community fact-check cause the White House to delete one of their tweets that was inaccurate.

Now with that being said I just realized that in order to participate in this community fact-checking you need to sign up for that service which as of now is called “Birdwatch” but will be renamed to Community Notes. 

So if you want to participate in this, you gotta make sure you sign up!

So while no boot would be great. And not voting may seem to make a statement. If the bootlickers all vote for the heavy boot, then YOU will still be living with the heavy boot.

So you can tell yourself you didn’t participate and you’re a rebel. But you will still be under their thumb. 

Or you could choice the lesser of 2 evils and try and work with what you have to move them more towards an An-Cap position over time. Because An-Cap isn’t going to happen overnight. It is not some magical land that will just appear. Live with reality.

I just fear they are going to be the right position in 80% of issues, but apply 80% of their energy into anything but those issues.  We could end up with a lot of lip service to the areas where we have alignment.

&#x200B;

It's not that they don't have government.

It's that their government is a corporation. Lower tax, no welfare. Still many rules, for better or worse, but reasonably done.

&#x200B;

I think it's a step on the right direction

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pr%C3%B3spera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pr%C3%B3spera)

[https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/prospectus-on-prospera](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/prospectus-on-prospera)

However, hardcore ancap may not like it. Why? Because Prospera is in a sense, government. Ancap don't want government because government is coercive.

However, some feature of Prospera make this grey area

>Wait, sign the social contract? Yes. Contra your Political Science professor, there’s a literal social contract **which you literally sign** (officially: ""Agreement Of Coexistence...which stipulates that the resident is explicitly, freely, and voluntarily consenting to the governance structures, rulemaking systems, and authority of Próspera"").  
>  
>And wait, membership fee? Yes. It’s $260/year for Hondurans, $1300 for foreigners, maybe more for corporations. This is separate from normal taxes, and goes to HPI as part of their compensation for running the ZEDE.  
>  
>Are people actually up for this? HPI says a thousand Hondurans have already applied. Since there’s currently only one building complex in Próspera, it's safe to say that the supply of interested residents will be exceeding demand for a long time.

&#x200B;

Also

>Charter cities fall into an awkward crack in libertarian ideology. Almost every **libertarian agrees that you can make rules (even arbitrary rules) about what people can do on your own property, and anyone who wants to stay on your property has to follow your rules. But what’s the difference between that, versus a government “owning” its territory and making rules for its citizens?** In practice the difference is that going in someone’s house - or even their golf course - is a choice you made, and they have clear title of ownership. But being in a country happens involuntarily, and the President doesn’t “own” America in the same way an ordinary person might own a house.  
>  
>**But if someone did own an entire city, and you chose to be in that city, theoretically they should be able to make whatever laws they wanted, and not even the most zealous libertarian could protest. The issue hadn’t really come up before. But here we are.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Anarcho capitalists want everything to be privatized. Well, if the government itself is privatized, then BINGO right.

Right of the bat, I see they do many things right.

For example, one of the main problem with libertarian and ancap is government excessive regulation.

Drugs are expensive because they need licensing.

They have a perfect solution. Any drug approved in any developed country is automatically approved in Prospera.

Their immigration law is also simple. Pay money you get in. Also they don't accept communists, islamists, or criminals. That's exactly what I've been thinking. Main enemy of capitalism are communists and islamists.

Head tax of $1300 a year. Now to be frank, because I am an internet marketer, I do not see how moving there is worth the money. I can do what I do now here. But if one day tax in my country start getting hostile against crypto marketer, I will move there. The thing is I have 1 mistress, 3 children and so on. So that head tax ramp up quickly. Once I have 10 million dollars, it won't be an issue.

I don't know how they handle drugs and narcotic.

However, I like how they handle medical licensing. You can shop and choose regulation you like, or you can pay insurance. The insurance company will decide if actual harms actually occur or not. Not government officials.

Finally. Licensing by someone that actually care about actual damage.

I think narcotic and gun should be done similarly. Ask insurance company that you won't use your gun to rob bank and you won't get high and shoot people and that you will safeguard your guns from being stolen or stuff. Let the insurance company decides if it worths insuring you.

I  know ancap don't like good government. They want no government.

But look. Ancap recognize private parties right? That include property right. What about if a private company own the whole city? Shouldn't they have right to govern their own property? And if the government is more free than average, why not?

Hello ancaps.

On the ""darkweb"" there is a website similar to Reddit or ancaps.win, you may have heard about it already; Dread. If you haven't? No worries.
Feel free to check this video: https://youtu.be/TgfLWfkA2hE?t=25.

Nothing so scary. It's safe to say this forum is as free as it gets. And most importantly.. anonymous!
There is a new subdread! /d/ancap.

Some people might benefit from this. Here is the link: http://dreadtoobigdsrxg4yfspcyjr3k6675vftyco5pyb7wg4pr4dwjq.b32.i2p/d/ancap
Feel free to visit and share your thoughts, perhaps make a post of your own. Unfortunately, no pictures so no memes. :-(

It's a bit difficult to access Dread nowadays, due to constant ""DoS"" attacks, but here is a quick video tutorial on how you can do it on a Windows 10: https://streamable.com/r20mzk

Alternatively, if you believe in yourself, you'll need an i2p client and preferably the tor browser and a vpn to ensure extra anonymity, but this is a bit complicated to set up. (yes, it cannot be accessed through regular internet) 

You can read more about i2p on Wikipedia or their official site. 
Volunteers to help with the wiki on-site are welcome.

Censorship has been something the US government has always attempted, through the espionage act and others, they have quietly censored the populace for years, you just had to say the right things. Now, within an Ancap society you would also have censorship, I personally work in R&D and had to sign an ND statement so that I couldn't spill company secrets, makes sense.

One day I received an alert on my phone that my car insurance was up for renewal and I had missed the deadline, the previous day. I paid immediately on the spot.

Fast forward to this Saturday 10/29 I received a notice in the mail from the Office of Motor Vehicles about this matter, which I had already forgotten about. Apparently, I need to pay a fine and provide proof of insurance.

\*Note that they know when you don't have it, even if for less than a day, but can't seem to figure out if you got it back on their own.

Due to the incompetence of the post office, while this notice was dated 10/21, I did not receive it until 10/29, with them only giving you 10 days to square this up from the notice date. So today, 10/31. A Monday.

\*If you don't square this up, your license and registration will be suspended until you do.

Being that there was nothing I could do about this on a Sunday, I had to take care of it today.

Tried calling several times, and all I got was an automated message that stated that the lines were ""so busy"" that they could not even put me on hold.

I then leave work and go drive to the Office of Motor Vehicles. Too bad, this cannot be taken care of in person, it must be done via phone, mail, or fax. I assume you would have to pay by mail in any case as, guess what, you can't just pay with cash or check, no, you need a cashier's check or money order.

The government's sole purpose is to be so mind-numbingly inconvenient in the way they rob you, that they use that as a reason why they need to steal even more from you. That way they can make the process less painful, they promise.",-8797328980962680384,1

On October 29th, Craig Sellars, co-founder of Tether.to, tweeted the following:

&nbsp;

[Nikolai Muchgian, 29-yr old #stablecoin innovator, #BitShares contributor, $DAI architect/@MakerDAO co-founder has died in San Juan #PuertoRico](https://twitter.com/OmniCraig/status/1586432239105060864)

&nbsp;

And he linked the following article:

[Muere un hombre de 29 años arrastrado por las corrientes en playa de Condado.](https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/seguridad/notas/muere-un-hombre-de-29-anos-arrastrado-por-las-corrientes-en-playa-de-condado/)

&nbsp;

The article translates as follows:

>A 29-year-old man swept away by currents dies on Condado beach

>A 29-year-old man died Friday morning after being swept away by sea currents on the beach behind Ashford Hospital in County, the Police Bureau said.

>According to a police report, the incident was reported at 9:15 a.m. when authorities were alerted that the man, identified as Nicolai Arcadie Muchgian, had been dragged.

>Rescue personnel managed to rescue his body that no longer showed vital signs, it was reported. 

>According to the authorities, the injured party was a resident of San Juan. 

>Agent Rosario, assigned to the Isla Verde Tourist Precinct, was in charge of the complaint.

&nbsp;

Now here is where it gets strange.  

Leading up to his death, Nikolai began to send out cryptic tweets.  

These are a few tweets that I found since September.  

I'm sure I missed a few.  

&nbsp;

September 4th:

A limiting factor of the state's growth is that the more of a percentage the state steals of a person's labor through taxes, the better it is for them to just circumvent it by just working for themselves: producing their own consumables like food, clothes, soaps, lumber etc or providing their own services like construction. 

The only reason why the state can get away with taking 20%-50% of your wages is because of the capitalistic aspects of our economy creating efficiency through economies-of-scale so that our food is extremely cheap to produce and singly specialized service providers become alot more efficient than a jack of all trades homesteader.. 
It was predicted that by 1975 we would be working 22hrs a week because of those economies of scale but I believe the state has purposefully raised taxes/inflation to keep us productive as tax slaves. So instead of the people reaping those benefits the state has gotten them instead so that we could never build any wealth.",450501084730146546,1

So, first thing that comes to my mind is whatever that is inside my wallet. If things go to shit, so will my stocks in the Brazilian Market. A reminder to everyone around here would be to start sending money to accounts in other countries. And cripto, I guess. When I think of Lula, all that comes into my mind is how my hours of work will go to waste If the local currency collapses. 

I'm looking for a job, and most jobs in my career path are a ""work from home"" kind of deal. I will not feel that safe walking around town If we go near an economic collapse in Brazil. So yeah, a source of income that involves working from a ""home office"" sounds like ""protection"", specially If one is able to work from home to totally different country. 

But when it comes to physical protection, It's basically impossible to get guns down here, so I'm not protected in that sense. But maybe It's a good idea to get literally surviving stuff, maybe a plan b (food and supplies). 

Regarding freedom of speech, well... If things REALLY go to shit, I guess that heavily censored countries are able to communicate using Tor Browser and other things like VPNs to do simple IP masking.

3411,yih1pu,Arguments for legalizing drugs,"Talking to two conservative friends about legalizing drugs, their argument is the impact on society would be worse than it is now.  - More crime, more addiction, less productivity - that legalization of drugs would have a much bigger negative impact on society then it does now.  They cite reports from Denver on weed legalization were supposedly crime and auto wrecks have skyrocketed, worker productivity  has tanked etc.

They do acknowledge the drug war is a failure though and the economic benefits of legalization so they are kind of getting there.  But they really are focusing on protecting society as a whole, and that hard core drug use (Coke, heroin, speed, etc) indirectly hurts others.

My counter was that it would put the cartels out of business, save billions annually in taxes, that addiction may go up temporarily but will level out and decrease long-term.  Overdose deaths and drug crime would drop dramatically.   I also argued that if a person decides they want to try coke for example it's their business, and they are not directly hurting anyone.  They countered that it indirectly hurts family, friends and hurts society as a whole -  this is what really bothers them.

Whenever somebody questions an inconsistency and a government body chooses option 2, its always seemingly the individual's fault for questioning the inconsistency.

E.g. a local school had a parent ask why drawings and miniatures of warplanes and soldiers werent allowed due to ""violent"" content or being ""replica weapons"" but the textbooks were free to depict paintings such as Francisco Goya's The Third of March 1808 and Picasso's Guernica. The school apparently began to redact everything that was a war related image from the textbooks and now other parents are blaming the questioner for ""sabotaging"" history education by ""provoking"" the school.

It reminds me of the people who blame the French Resistance for causing the deaths of civilians during ww2 because whenever they killed a German officer 50 civilians would be executed in retaliation.

Oh yes, it does exist, even though no one talks about it out there... It does.

The internacional media is printing our current president Bolsonaro as a dictator like fascist and the candidate ex-president Lula as a moderate social democrat, but this is a LIE. Lets go with the facts:

- Our Supreme Court is arresting political opposition (opposition to court) and journalists;

- Journalists have been literally EXILED;

- They sent an agent to the newspaper opposed to Lula to literally censor any new against Lula and force them to praise Lula.

- And Bolsonaro is going against it, while Lula supports it and helps them.

So who is the dictator?

We are facing a great danger.

I am not here to support Bolsonaro or anyone, I don't support any politician, I am here to tell you the truth about what we have been passing through during the last years. So, please, if you can, share the message of this post and the previous one with everyone you can, the world needs to know what is happening here, and not what a bunch of actors say on the internet.

Bolsonaro is a moderate conservative, far from being the fascist (great anachronism by the way) the international media tries to print him as.

And Lula is a declared COMMUNIST. The very satute of his party says that they follow a comunist ideology.

And our history with comunism is old...

The comunists started trying to take power in 1961, it was organized by a man named Clodomir dos Santos Morais, he created a terrorist group that was trained in Cuba to make a revolution from the countryside to the city... But his plans were frustrated because the military staged a coup d'état before he could do that himself.

But the terrorist groups kept being trained, they would make terrorist attacks and create paramilitary groups to try to take power by force and establish a socialist dictatorship. Many famous people here were part of that, Brizola, Marighella... and Dilma Rousseff (you probably know her, yes, she was a terrorist).

The comunist threat really existed, and it does not make the military dictatorship good, just as their bad actions doesn't make terrorism good.

And the threat didn't stop. When the military dictatorship ended they decided to change the strategy and to change thing inside out on the elections. Parties like PT and PDT were formed.

Yes, PT, Lula's party, was created to follow the democratic socialism theory (not to be confused with social democracy, that, unlike democratic socialism, doesn't believe on achieving the complete planning of the economy and, after that, comunism), that holds that socialism must be achieved via elections gradually (it is written on the statute of their party yhar they follow it), and Lula himself already said on interviews that he believes that it is too difficult to implement socialism on Brazil and that it must be done gradually; and they started to do it by following Granmisci's theory and working to change the culture of Brazil in order to make it easier to implement socialism.

During years Lula and many others kept meeting with many comunist dictators from Latin America on a meeting called Foro de São Paulo (the meeting is public and everything is documented) in order to plan their actions, and when the social democrats (Fernando Henrique Cardoso, PSDB) finally lost the election to the comunists, Lula was able to rise to power and begin his actions.

We had a complete transformation of our public education, with indoctrination being taught to children in order to promote comunism on our culture, Lula placed his supporters on the Supreme Court, and they used corruption to buy votes on the Congress to pass the laws they wanted (originally they wanted to get a majority of deputies, but they failed).

After Lula's second mandate he steped down and elected his follower Dilma Rousseff, who kept following their plans and tried to pass a decree to take away the power of the Congress and give it to small local soviet like concils created by them... But their plans failed...

Why it happened? First because they were unable to predict the technological innovation and dissemination of information through the internet (that frustrated their plans to control culture via indoctrination), second because there was a huge economic crisis caused by the government during Dilma's second mandate that pissed off the population, and third because Dilma's zero charisma brought high unpopularity. The population manifested, and the Congress impeached her, Michel Temer, the vice-president, assumed. And Lula was arrested for corruption.

It was 2018 and Bolsonaro won the election, literally the first right wing president we got in decades, but the system didn't like it... The Supreme Court started to act dictatorially and to be gradually more and more tyrannical, taking the role of Congress to create laws and creating laws to sabotage his government, while increasingly censored the media and opposition. We had deputies being politically persecuted and journalists being exiled from the country (like Alan dos Santos), but no one talks about it out there. And they they used a judicial hack to free Lula and allow him to run for president again.

We are on the elections now, and the Supreme Court is acting like a dictatorship doing everything it can to help Lula. They literally sent an agent inside the biggest newspaper of opposition to the PT to prevent them from saying anything against Lula and force them to praise him, they are censoring any means of communication or political propaganda that is against Lula... And Lula supports it, and openly says that he wants to censor media and internet when he returns to power, and that he wants to put people favorable to him at the head of the army, and create a national guard to serve him.

The comunist threat is real, their previous plan failed and now they want to implement socialism at any cost... Our basic rights, out freedoms, our lifes, are at risk, and, still, on the rest o the world, Lula is portrayed as some kind Santa Claus.

Our lives are at risk, so is our future. This is the hard truth the international media doesn't want you to know.",9093713805983948697,1

And the Supreme Court is responsible for this.

The journalists who disagree from the Supreme Court have been being literally EXILED and even ARRESTED. They literally sent an agent inside the jorunals to check every new or material and CENSORED everything that doesn't agree with them. The political opposition (opposition to the Supreme Court) is being CENSORED and ARRESTED. We have people fleeing from Brazil because they are being persecuted, we are having all our basic rights destroyed and ANNIHILATED one by one.

And what does everyone around the World does about this? They support the exact candidate who upholds it. All those actors and celebrities who doesn't live here use bullshit excuses just as amazon to support the exact candidate who literally said that he supports the media and internet censorship. When it is their country they want someone different to rule, but when it is about our they support a comunist who said he wants to censor media.

And yes, he is a comunist, this is not a theory, this is not some kind of exaggeration, it is literally said on the statute of his party that they follow one of the comunist ideologies, and he said himself that he thinks that the implementation of socialism in Brazil must be gradual.

The internacional media prints this ideia that Lula is a modetate when he meets with all the DICTATORS from latin America to plan their agenda together. This is not a theory, their meetings are public, it is a documented fact.

But the international media doesn't want you to know about it...

It wants you to see Mark Hamill and DiCaprio singing Imagine and pretending our government as a free and pretty lovely organization while we are arrested for disagreeing with the state and exiled for exercising the right to freedom of speech, while we are literally living on a DICTATORSHIP.

We are living on a dictatorship and we need the World to know it.

In order to move people from one political state of being to another, education is required. If you are here at An-Cap, you likely either are interested in knowing more about An-Cap or believe in some or all of its philosophy. And it logically follows that we want more people to grasp and follow an An-Cap philosophy.

Since joining this sub-reddit, I have noticed that even here many (not all) misuse terms such as fascism, anarchy, communism, etc. and where they sit on the continuum in relation to one another. In order to help better define these for everyone, I have included the 2 links below. Please read them and then feel free to discuss below. 

I would also recommend saving and then sharing these links with others when these issues arise in conversations. As stated previously, in order to move minds, they must be educated. Thank you.

3486,ygku7c,An anti-war machine. How?,"Was talking about the movie Dr. Strange love with my teenage kid, and it got me thinking about the current situation in Ukraine, and the rising tensions toward nuclear annihilation. However, it is the very concept of mutually assured destruction that makes anything other than a proxy war actually likely.

So what's the scaled down version that makes even proxy wars unfightable?

Not that I want the world filled with more weapons systems, but clearly this community is cool with well armed citizens.

Now, I recognize wars are a product of states, and getting rid of the state goes a long way. But assuming states will continue to exist, how do we actually prevent war?

Like, if Ukraine had a massive fleet (say, 100,000) micro drones along the border, loaded with grenades, such that EVERY soldier crossing the border was immediately destroyed, what soldier would cross? It would dismantle the apparatus of the state (the army) necessary to occupy a territory. Combined with space lasers or some stuff to zap any aerial encroachment, sovereign borders could actually be protected.

This only works if BOTH sides are this equipped (otherwise nothing could stop the superior force pushing their boundary protection outward).

Is the only solution to ending war more weaponization toward MAD - but micro scale enough to generally ONLY destroy military targets? Nukes are indiscriminate destruction. A drone/laser border force could be far more selective and able to avoid the majority of civilian casualties.",1230476107135480287,1
3487,yftsz9,Thoughts on Kanye,"It is frustrating me that no one in the alternative media is speaking my language, probably out of fear, so I’m making a post. If it gets removed so be it. I have criticisms of both Kanye and his detractors. 

The people who are genuinely butthurt about his comments are behaving like npc’s, that includes Lex Fridman who I think is a talented interviewer. If you replace “Jew” with “white” in his tweet or any of his comments he wouldn’t only be left alone he would be celebrated. Saying that white people hold positions of power is perfectly in line with the regimes message but rightfully pointing out that the majority of the people at the top of the hierarchy within mainstream media  particularly within talent agencies happen to be Jewish is somehow egregious beyond comprehension. I’m not going to pretend to know the exact demographics but take a look at the board of directors of the big 3 talent agencies (CAA endeavour, uta) and the publishers in mainstream media, it doesn’t take long to notice a pattern. I would agree that he is unnecessarily generalizing a group based on the actions of a select few but he’s not wrong when he says saying “Jewish media” is redundant. Furthermore the more he gets genuinely blacklisted the more his point is proven that there is a certain group that is above criticism in this domain. At least more so than any other group. 

Now, I’m in agreement with Ye’s comments about what the media is celebrating and promoting to the youth and how it is essentially evil, however his comments and frustration about Jewish over representation and how artists are being gauged shows naivety on his part. More importantly the fact that no one can give him a straight answer regarding his concerns shows the immature state our cultures dialogue is in. The reason Jewish people are over represented in media, law, accounting etc. is for the exact same reason East Asians are over represented in engineering and medicine but no one wants to confront those pesky statistics regarding race and iq. Even if it doesn’t capture the whole story it’s a significant portion. Regarding talent being gauged in contract, first off he’s trying to fix a dying industry considering the decentralization that the internet has provided for new artists. And, although it’s no secret the entertainment industry has been historically predatory, no one is forcing anyone to sign the contracts and if your lawyers are consistently getting you the short end of the stick  it’s probably time to hire a new lawyer, maybe one with a yarmulke.

My thesis is that women starting to vote was the beginning of the downfall for USA. From prohibition and electing that shitbag FDR, neither of these would have happened if not for women's suffrage.

Additionally, women in developed countries know less about politics than their male counterparts worldwide.

These are great times to be alive,.

Sadly in remote areas of my native Congo people still live in terrible conditions even tho it's one of the richest countries in the world and has most fertile soil in the world.

3583,yf4as1,Anti-IP Anarcho-capitalism can't stand the test of time.,"Eventually human technology will reach a point where all physical labor can be done by robots.  People will only do physical work if they want to.  Almost all people will purely perform intellectual labor.  Sure, no one will need to work as all of their needs and most of their desires will be so cheap that a thousand people can live off of the charity of a single worker.

More importantly, if creating something with your own labor and possessions from that which is unowned is the only way to establish ownership, and even that isn't valid unless your labor is physical, then few people will own anything that wasn't created by one of the minority that does small amounts of physical labor and given to them as charity. 

Think about it this way.  One rich man on an asteroid 50 years ago brought in a large number of robots and an automated factory.  10k people move there, and he gives them a home with a moderate number of amenities.  These 10k people now live entirely off of his generosity.  Even if they owned a robot or a factory, there would be no need for their stuff.  The robot could mine, and the factory produce, but what would be the point if everyone already has what they need and want?  Are you making people's pet projects for them?  Why do they go to you instead of just using the other factory?  Even if they do you merely become one of the few that actually can sustain a claim of ownership over things you produced.

And that's if the rich man doesn't claim the entire asteroid, and gives you robots and a factory.  But let's say he did claim it, but he also gave you a ship, a hundred robots, and a fabricator so you can start your own settlement.  You head out to a nearby asteroid and do exactly what he did.  You build a spin-grav cylinder inside it and invite people to join you.  Congratulations.  You just became the new owner of an entire colony.  You are the only one to have first rights to anything on the asteroid, and everyone else lives off of your generosity.  They work for free, for the people around them, and all of their funding, if they need more, also comes from you.  You are now the Lord of your own Fiefdom, and they are happy to join you, despite never being able to own things that they weren't gifted.

&#x200B;

And things only get worse if technology advances to the point where we can upload minds.  At that point, their entire existence is information.  They are an idea, information in the same way that their DNA is information.  And because no one can own an idea, they can't even own themselves.  They can't even own their original DNA, as it is just information.  And without the ability to own themselves, ownership and the concept of rights is meaningless.

(Rant about how corporatism and woke capitalism put us in clown world ),"Most people on the left will argue that their ideas are against the views of the elites and large corporations despite a strong body of evidence going against that claim. Everywhere we look we see woke capitalist giant corporations advocating for a sixteen dollar minimum wage, encouraging  BLM riots  and trying to cancel culture conservatives and libertarians they don't like, and with hyper centralized web media platforms they can do it.

  In example Amazon wants a sixteen dollar minimum wage to kill small business, in 2020 all the big tech companies zealously endorsed the covid lock downs while small business owners lost all hope and BLM thugs ran rampant through the streets destroying private property while they made trillions. All the big tech companies want a world where everything digital is centralized and interdependent around them so they can control the flow of information and Govern us.  In a lawsuit against big tech, Donald Trump called big tech ""State Actors"" to describe how they always side with authoritarian left leaning policies and with their all powerful abilities censor and control the flow of information the generic public sees. Though I am not a Trump supporter I believe this is the case. Big tech and the public school system is the reason I think the culture is heading so far authoritarian left. The authoritarian left will always side with policies that lead to more centralization. Centralized health care, centralized currency with the Fed, and in my personal life centralized cloud based software with strong patent law to kill big techs competition. 

 America's left makes social inequality look like the biggest scariest boogie man and likens it to racism.  They also fail to distinguish between real threatening and violent forms of racism and non violent forms of racism (such as people shitposting on 4chan).  For the left ""racism is teh boogie man. ahhhh""   In my opinion I think racism is irrational and idiotic thinking and I am a fan of black economic thinkers like Thomas Sowell,  but it is not dangerous unless combined with centralization of power.  In example, Racism with centralization of power is Hitler or the Klan (circa 1920s). Racism without centralization of power is a shit poster on 4chan.

I also mentioned in inequality. Well contrary to what the left believes Inequality has nothing to do with racism.  In equality is part of freedom, and having Government (and corporate) central planners involved trying to prevent inequality will lead to a end game where we are all living equal in state funded housing pods. Tell that to your liberal college professor spewing left wing bullshit. To finalize my rant I believe the core problem is the left doesn't see danger in centralization. They embrace a world where Governments (and behind the scene large corporations) centrally control everything.  The mainstream left is helping the corruption they claim to want to stop and centralization of power is completely under their radar.

When we look for John Rockfeller's ""standard oil company"" we can see that he seen an incredible potential in the sector and he got in to this market early and got really big as a company. Until this point its all fine because its just a great example of entrepreneurship. But when his company got real big, because of the economies of scale he has and also the capital he has, he could force other oil companies to quit. For instance he once sold petrol with a loss for him in order to make other companies bankrupt or to acquire them. He could force other companies to bankrupt or to acquire them because he had incredible amount of capital. Even he was selling the petrol under the cost, (which his cost was much lower than the other companies because of economies of scale i mentioned) it was fine to have loss because he knew if he acquaire that company, he was going to gain that market of area already. With this technuqie, after a while he had the control of oil in America. And since oil just an resource that can drain away, if he has control over most of the market it means that he will own limited resources for his own company only. So that his company can be a monopoly or monopoly-like in the market because he will own most of the control of an oil which is limited. From a liberterian perspective, you would probably be against the regulations because it would spoil the balance that normally market has, so I wanted to ask what kind of action could have been taken in this situation if regulations are not used?",-868311403764753335,1

3679,yc0nv7,My Introduction,"Hi there r/Anarcho_Capitalism.

I'm Sw, I just wanted to introduce myself to the subreddit.

I'm a Paleoconservative in support of the Free Market and have been for about a year or so. I'm joining this subreddit because I hold sympathy towards Anarcho-Capitalism and as I have described it to my friends ""Anarchism, but they have braincells"". I've actually been in debates with friends and people on the internet about Anarcho-Capitalism, specifically because of how fondly I've spoken of it and how I actively defend the Free Market and to an extent, Anarcho-Capitalism itself.

My primary motivator for joining is that I've been in an AnCap Discord Server for a while but they've practically died when Summer ended and thus I need a new place to learn more about Capitalism through discussion, and also get aid in debates by receiving good arguments against items such as welfare.

Sorry for the bit of the textwall, I uh, am a bit too descriptive and talkative.

Anyways, looking forward to talking with you all!

Then if this confederation then belongs to an even greater confederation at which again representatives from each confederation are present, ... You get the idea.

I think long-term ad hoc organization would, perhaps by necessity if not convenience, transform into a directly democratic structure. People want certainty, predictability, security. So I think 'anarchy' would be a transitory precursor to a state.

We tend to think of a state as an institution that has jurisdiction over a given portion of land and the resources therein. Well, wouldn't a commune, village, whatever be the same? By necessity a region will need an agreed upon administrative body.  So by necessity this landmass needs sub-dividing into administrative regions. We already have this today. Look at a map.

That will be the man who has nothing to gain from you.  But let him come and you'll scream your empty heads off, howling that he's a selfish monster.

I post this CBC story as a warning. It has a personal connection, my ex-wife was one of the South Asians kicked out of Uganda in 1972. She was an infant, and her family came with mere dollars in their pockets, after being given 90 days to leave the country or be killed.

Statists gonna state.

Those who are familiar with my posts and comments here know I'm not an AnCap, but when I read stories like this and when I used to talk to my inlaws (back when I was married haha) it used to make my blood boil -- i get pretty AnCap at moments like that. That's what happens when you give up your guns. Idi Amin could ""cleanse"" Uganda because nobody could say no and put up a resistance.

Ironically, most of my former inlaws are docile liberal statists..this is spite of being forcibly removed from their original country. Amazingly, you'd think they'd distrust government. But nope, Pierre Trudeau (a liberal) allowed them into Canada where they made their lives again, and you'd think Jistin Trudeau was the second coming. They love him.  High taxes, loads of laws and regulations, limits to freedoms in the name of protecting everybody? They love it.

But literally this could happen here. We've already seen bank accounts frozen for Wrongthink. Mandated vaccinations on penalty of job loss. Gun bans. Free speech limits. This is Uganda in slow motion.

>The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office in September calculated the debt forgiveness would cost the government about $400 billion.

We spent more on the war in Afghanistan, war in Iraq, COVID and support for Ukraine. The higher education industry is a scam and forces students into debt at the benefit of universities and professors. Why not allow this student debt relief fo through?

I think the one move that would make everyone support this would be to take the money from universities directly.",-7960795263667399286,1

Relevant article (in French): https://lp.ca/sArpkD?sharing=true

So, to fight cLiMaTE chAngE, they want to tax people for the amount of kilometres you drive. Taxing you for every liter of fuel, for your plates, for your insurance, for your driver’s license and for buying your car apparently isn’t enough for the government. 

My main concern, though, is not the financial aspect of it. They want to force us to turn on an app whenever you get in your car to track you and “calculate your milage”. This government app would be able to track you in real time. I wonder how it be used against us, say when some wanna-be dictator locks us up from 7pm to 5 am because of “COVID”, or when people go protest by forming convoys.

Thus, to move us towards An-Cap in America will require 3 things.

1.	A reduction in the size of the State (decrease government at the local, state, and especially federal levels)
2.	Education of civics and history to the citizens
3.	Moving the Overton window to adjust how people view freedom, state intervention, and interactions amongst individuals to allow true capitalism to occur and boats to rise.

Unfortunately, number 1 seems to continue to grow. But with an emphasis on 2 and 3, could be adjusted with the right personnel elected. Yes, that means participating in something we may abhor, but it is like taking some medicine that tastes bad but is good for you in the long run.

Ideas for how we can educate millions of people who don’t even understand the basics of our own US government (or for those in other countries, your basic governmental structure) is thrown open for suggestion. 

Moving the Overton window is usually done via responsible and harmonious social interaction without talking down to someone. Explaining the how and the why of An-Cap can help change people’s minds. We can do this both on the net and in person. Other suggestions are welcome.

I would even support, for example, a city where alcohol is prohibited, as long as everyone is onboard (contractual obligations). Same for guns, marijuana, etc.

(OTOH, I think the idea that a majority of 51% should decide if you're allowed to smoke MJ or own guns is abhorrent).

Also, not everyone understand what ancap - or even the ""anarchist"" and ""capitalist"" bits - mean. Is voluntarism a better term for this?",-7607460792815403666,1

I recognize South Florida has a fair amount of liberal leftist, but come on ... do you people not live in reality? I see this sub complain about how expensive rent is, how the cost of living is ridiculous and although I share some of these frustrations the solution and root causes this sub comes up with is absurd to the highest degree. Let's try to make this as simple as possible.

Supply &  Demand!

That may not be simple enough for a lot of you so I'll elaborate. Take a look at some of these articles below. 

[https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-citylab-how-americans-moved/](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-citylab-how-americans-moved/)

Do you see a common trend? People are moving to Florida, the demand for shelter has increased. 

Take a look at this way, you own an apartment and you rent it. You put it on the market and you get someone who wants to rent it for $100 but then someone else offers $200, then someone else offers $300. Do you get where I'm going with this? Why wouldn't you rent it to the highest bidder? The reason why rent is so high is simply because there's enough people from out of state willing to pay a premium to live in Miami, it's really that simple. 

The final point and this one really drives the nail in the coffin. Mortgage interest rates are approaching 7% a 20-year high. This makes buying a home extremely unaffordable, which adds even more pressure into the renting market. Why? We'll because anyone who's been priced out buying a home still needs a place to live so they'll rent instead. 

Now that we've addressed the root cause of the price increase what can we do to fix the issue? We'll obviously we have to increase the supply, seems simple enough, right? Wrong! 

Take a look into all the necessary licenses/permits needed to even begin thinking about building a property. This goes for any home with the intention of selling/ renting.

I intend to move to the countryside of Florida (probably Orlando) because it is a wealthy state that values right-wing policies, and also its weather is humid and hot, like the majority of Brazil.

But, watching videos of Nick Johnson and other Youtube channels, I have the impression that Florida is becoming too crowded (and expensive) and Texas would be a good alternative because it is also a right-wing state and has many job opportunities, even though I have to admit Biden's ""administration"" is ruining this great state by forcing illegal immigration through the Mexican border.

So, you would advise focusing only on Florida, or do you think Texas still is a good choice, even with the chaos caused by the Biden mismanagement?

4033,yngpcv,Terrible subs and channels that are deeply brainwashing people with far-left urban propaganda,"Subs like fuckcars and YouTube channels like Not Just Bikes are advocating for the “live in the pods eat the bugs” way of life.

Modern urbanists along with far-left fanatics want to take away your car and force you to live in high-density residential buildings just like how people used to live in the USSR.

It’s easier to control people when they depend on government-owned public transportation and when they’re all crammed in dense overpopulated cities.

The fact that this anti-car urban movement, that is especially indoctrinating vulnerable young people, is gaining traction, is concerning. A dangerous poison for our freedom and independence. 

This has to be a conspiracy. No wonder the algorithms are pushing for pro-urban crap YouTube videos to influence people into thinking that forced collectivization where people no longer own anything and have to share everything is supposedly a good thing.

You don’t get to own a private yard with a pool anymore. You have to use the public pools that are filled with perverts. Want to enjoy privacy outdoors? Your only option is communal spaces or public parks where you find thugs and pedophiles.

With Great Power we will denounce, oppose, criticize and destroy the new urbanism cult that is infesting the whole internet with propaganda that attempts to destroy our precious quality of life.

I see the role of the president of the United States of America as the most difficult job on the planet (we can discuss that, but I think that's the reality), and the issue with that is the fact that establishments want that role to be controlled by someone that they themselves can control. I am definetly and utterly disgusted by the fact that elections are guided on a direction that's not really decided by the population, and I think that Trump being elected before Biden was a glitch. A crack in the castle of glass, a blow of fresh breeze on the castle of cards that the industry established in the past decades. Voting for Trump is not just voting for Trump, the reality is that voting for him is equivalent to fighting a propaganda machine that is trying to destroy everything in regards to the freedom of any individual.This is much bigger than what folks can understand. Trump is the last attempt that people have at their disposal to make a difference. For all the people that can do something about it, and when elections will come, I beg you, do whatever is in your power to try and make others aware of what the world situation is.
Everytime the human race was in a situation of great peril, it all started with a few individuals that were able to advocate for the truth, that were able to make the masses open their eyes on what were the possible scenarios that the world was going towards.
Please, everyone, don't force your vision on others, just challenge their beliefs, understand that 99% of the world is under a spell called propaganda, understand that the minds of the public are brainwashed and instead of going to war against them, challenge their point of views and guide them on a more educated choice.
Constant conflicts between us will never serve a purpose.
We need to fight against the game, not the players.
Use facts against bullshit and kindness against hatred. I myself try continuously to persuade others from going down the rabbit hole that big tech, big pharma, and the industries are trying to guide the folks mind into, and other than that I can't do much more. 
But for everyone that lives in the US and knows other people there, you can make a BIG difference on the results of the next election.
Do a little bit of research, keep some material at hand, ready to demonstrate whatever your point is. Try to see the matter as a help that you give others to understand what's going on, and not a battle between races, political views and all that other bullshit that they want you to be polarized to.

TLDR Just voting is not enough. Do it, preferably in person, and help others to get to an educated decision. Not trying to be dramatic but I think that the entire world depends on the next USA elections",7912965708119458916,1

4115,yk2y9e,Left did to Brazil the same they did there,"The president the left ""elected"", Lula, is a convicted criminal. When he was a president he stole over 245 billions, local currency. He was convicted in 3 different courts. 31 judges convicted him of 26/29 charges. All his government were arrested too. There are plenty of evidence. So why is he free.

The superior court in Brazil changed the understanding of the law to set him free. They said he was judge in the wrong city. He was judged in Curitiba and he had to be judged in Brasília. He was supposed to be judged again. But he turned 75 and so part of the crimes were archived because he is old.
 
What happened to the Former Lula's government ? They were all arrested involved in crime. Except Dilma. She was elected president in 2010 and broke brazil. So she was impeached in 2016. Here the names of Lula's government that were arrested:

Former Minister Antonio Palocci - prisoner 
Former Minister José Dirceu - Prisoner 
José Genuíno - Prisoner
Antonio Vaccari Neto - Prisoner
Nestor Cervero - Prisoner
Delúbio Soares - Prisoner 
Renato Duque - Prisoner
Jorge Zelada - Prisoner
Paulo Roberto Costa - Prisoner
João Vaccari - Prisoner
Paulo Ferreira - Prisoner
Former Minister Paulo Bernardo - prisoner
Candido Vaccarezza - prisoner
Delcídio do Amaral - Prisoner 
Pedro Barusco - Prisoner
André Vargas - Prisoner
Aldemir Bendine - Prisoner
Wagner Pinheiro - Prisoner
Othon Silva - Prisoner
Dilma - Impeachment


The artists and news wanted him elected because they are interested in the government fund Lula gives them. We have a law for culture that gives money to artists. You would think they give young artists and people from the middle of nowhere founds to help ... But no. Only the famous celebrities get the money. The Brazilian Trump cut that and gives the money to who needs it. So all the left media gang in him. 

We don't have freedom of speech. I m against Lula, and that automatic means I m fascist. All the black people that are against him are called fascist or ""capitão do mato"". A news channel was silenced and they had to fire the ""trump supporters""  reporters that is against Lula because the judge said she can't talk bad about him. And they are making they say that Lula is innocent. He isn't

People of the favelas only have the option to vote for Lula. The drug dealers gave them a 'suggestion'. That they should vote on Lula because they won't accept anyone voting on the Brazilian trump. The drug dealers and organize crimes are supporting Lula because in the past 4 years they lost money and got arrested. And during Lula's government they had an arrangement.

Ortega, Nicaragua dictator, is best friends with Lula. Search what is happening in Nicaragua. And Maduro is besties with Lula too. Maduro and Lula are so close he made the weekly Venezuelan magazine all about Lula being a hero. That Lula will save the world from the capitalism. And during Lula and Dilma government they gave the dictators money to help them.  

The left blamed Bolsonaro, Brazilian trump, for the CVID deaths. Like they did with Trump! They say he didn't buy the vaccine. In USA the first vaccined was in December 14. In Brazil it was January 17. The time of manufacture and for the our CDC aprove it. Pzier contract was hard to sign. Because the president would take all the responsibility for the vaccines, at the time of the negotiations they hadn't verify if it worked. In the contract pzier couldn't be blamed. We had to pay upfront. They didn't know when and if they could deliver it. Because all worl wanted. And if they were to deliver it would be only 500 000 shots. Would you sign this?

4123,yk2ap3,The Brazilian Trump,"The Brazilian trump lost the election. Trump actually sent the Brazilian people a great message telling us to vote on the right guy.

But it didn't matter because the election was clearly stolen. The ""elected"" president, Lula, was convicted by 30 judges because he stole 245 billions reais from the people. And he supported Venezuela and Cuba dictators. They are actually best friends. Maduro did an issue of Venezuela magazine saying how Lula is going to save the world from the capitalism.

If you look USA now is isolated. All latin America is red and it's so scary. 

I m angry how the Avengers using their hero status told people to vote on a criminal. They did the whole ""not all heros wear capes"".  In the times square they put images of the Brazilian trump saying goodbye before the election.

I just wanted to let you guys know how there are a global agenda against people like us. They here say we are fascist, there they call you Nazis. 

The supreme court silenced journalists that told the truth. Last night they blocked Whatsapp and telegram groups of people resisting. 

The news channel here get an aid from the government. The Brazilian trump cut it because the poor need aid not famous celebrities. So they all manipulated the people. Twisting the truth. 

The new president actually said he will regulate the internet and news and religion. And people voted on him. They think we need to be silenced because we are evil. They will take the civil guns but the drug dealers can have it. 

My point is. People are stupid and will twist the truth. The news will twist it.  They will say we live in a parallel universe. That we are Nazis/fascists, homophobic, racist, anti earth, dumb, conspiracy theorists...  because they don't have the facts. We do. 

I can prove Brazilian trump was the best ever. And because they can't argue it they scream we are fascists. 

Don't give up. The world is actually against people like us. That uses facts and numbers. For them the right thing is to throw tomato sauce in a famous paintings to protest oil 😂  Brazilians are being silenced. It's up to you guys save the world from the red. 

Sorry for the rambling.. I m scared from what's to come. I m going to add video to show you.",7533577320730652412,1

Nor is there a sane buyer in sight to do what is needed to be done for a balanced platform within reason.  Truth Social is up and running, while Elon Musk took over Twit and it looks like the Red Wave is real and coming to right the ship which is being applauded across the board.  And most of the action and info will likely be in those two platforms (in real time) whether you're Trump, Independent, Conservative or just plain Normal inclined.

But that's not going to change anything here in Reddit, simply because (and unlike Twitter) this place is not worth buying because it's built mostly by Trolls and Troll Servers.  So, my question is, what are your plans?  Stick it out here for a little while, maybe abandon Reddit for the same reasons which plagued Twitter and build anew by joining on top of those others, or wait and see?",6099079293952486742,1

This year’s midterm elections are playing out as a strange continuation of the last presidential race — and a potential preview of the next one.

Donald Trump, who refused to exit the stage after his defeat, has spent months raging against Joe Biden, reshaping downballot campaigns that normally function as a straightforward referendum on the incumbent president.

The result is an episode of political shadowboxing with little precedent, as the current president and his immediate predecessor — and possible future challenger — crisscross the country in support of their party’s candidates.

4427,y48xzr,Nobody has been able to explain exactly how the coup would have happened to succeed,"January 6th has been called a ""failed coup"", and the media and the corrupt elite keeps claiming it was Trump's attempt to stay in power.

But I have never read or heard anyone explaining how they think Trump planned to go through with it.

So some protesters marched toward the capitol, practically all of them unarmed against closed doors and armed police and guards. They walk through the doors (assuming the armed forces were unable to stop them), and then what? Kills everyone inside, Trump then walks through the doors and leaders from all over the world calls him to congratulate him with the victory? 

Have they any idea how stupid it sounds? Hypothetically, if a president had done that, armed forces would soon arrive and drag him away (at least if it was a Republican president). 

The question remains unanswered; what would need to happen for a claimed coup attempt like that to succeed? As far as I know, the January 6 committee has still not given us such a scenario.

It was not an attempted coup, but if we imagine it was, Trump would only have done it if he believed there was a chance of success. And he is not that stupid to think this approach would have worked. At least the ""insurrectionists"" had the decency to not cross the velvet ropes inside the building.",9005507721043013480,1

4457,y3mwok,The Frog Didn't Realize,"Dark times. I still can't believe how it was done. I can't believe anyone believes it. I can become enraged when the thieves and their supporters gaslight us. It takes a lot of prayer and a conscience effort to control my anger. It's almost been 2 years. It has, surprisingly, went quickly. I am still holding on to some shred of how for 2024.
  2020 saw the liberal leaders doing everything in their power to divide and conquer our citizens. 99% of all media outlets, owned by the left, were constantly stoking the fires of racism. Our cities were being burned and looted. And it was being condoned! A 'white shame' was being pushed on every white American, regardless of our own beliefs. All the while, we conservatives are saying, 'we are not THAT!' It's so sickening to be accused of something just because of the color of your skin. And how hypocritical of the left!
  After the greatest steal, we lose our leader. Then we lose our collective voice, Rush Limbaugh. I can barely think about those days without crying. Soon after, we begin losing choices. All under the treachery of a MANUFACTURED virus and an, even more, manufactured pandemic! There was so much fear (part of the plan). So many people locked themselves inside of their homes. They were too afraid to work. They were to afraid to live. The masks... what the perfect visual to strike fear! Families, that were already divided over their support or their hate of Trump, were further divided by their opinions on THE VIRUS. People were demanded to wear masks. There were curfews set! People were not allowed to visit their dying loved ones, in hospitals! Schools were shut down! Scholorships were lost, championships were missed, senior years ruined and accumulative learning was lost. Businesses were forced to stay closed. Many AMERICANS lost their businesses that they had fought so hard to build. People lost their jobs. Manufacturing came to a halt. And THEN they tried to shove their poison vaccines into every American! Will you take the shot or lose your job? Do you believe what Fauci says? Do you believe what you see on TV? Do you ever stop to think who is in charge of what you see on TV? Sadly, many Americans took the bait. 
This was all planned. Fear, Covid relief government money and a laziness to seek the truth, made it very easy to fool the majority.
  January 6, 2021 was another manufactured event to remove the one player at the table that wasn't playing  their wicked game. The liberals in power, are playing a game called, 'Make America Insignificant' Trump is the fly in their ointment. 
  The media is in their pockets. The corrupt judges are sold out, Congressmen owe too much to keep their secrets. And the FBI has become, the very thing that they are supposed to protect us from! With all this power, I see America becoming just a chapter in future history books. 
  A few of us have seen through all of this. We tried to tell you. We begged you to listen. You were too busy feeling good about yourselves for hating yourselves for being white! You were too busy getting those warm fuzzies, supporting illegal immigration. You were so so busy worrying about not being able to kill your unborn children. You were so busy making heroes out of a criminal, resisting arrest and pumped up on fentanyl! You were just working so hard at congratulating each other about how truly righteous and morally exceptional you were, that you missed the crime. 
  I will never be able to forgive the guilty ones. It was and is a crime that will have everlasting consequences. I look at my grandkids and I know that by the time they are my age, this most unique, magnificent country will be unrecognizable. 
   That bothers me. It bothers me a lot.",-6598027831500151723,1

They’ll take a really long time to try Hunter, and we all know he will get a sweetheart deal, and will be pardoned by his dad in his way out of office.

4673,xp5sae,So tired of the fake media narrative,"It is repeated again and again. The media tells us that the MAGA-movement says the election was stolen simply because Trump says it was stolen, and that he has zero evidence to back it up. And because of that, they became involved in a failed coup on  January 6th.

This is wrong on so many levels. First of all people don't say the election was stolen just because Trump says it. Hypothetically, if Trump had suddenly turned 180 degrees and said; ""Biden won fair and square, it was an honest election, and I lost"", I would still say the election was rigged. Because people are able to see and think for themselves. They have seen all the evidence the media refuse to talk about.

When I first heard it would be Biden that was running against Trump, I took it for granted that Biden would lose. But I had strongly underestimated how far the deep state and grassroot leftists would go.

Still, if Trump lost and Biden won, I would accept the loss even if it would be a complete disaster for America and the Western world. As long as it was an honest and transparent election.

The morning after the election, when Biden was declared the winner, it felt like when Titanic hit the iceberg, and everybody seemed to be OK with it. But I accepted it, no matter how awful I felt.

Then I did the mistake of trusting MSM. They claimed that Trump was such a sore loser that he refused to admit defeat, and with zero evidence, accused Biden for cheating. So I was thinking; ""Come on Trump, you can be a better loser than that. Nobody is more disappointed than I am, but at least show some dignity"".

Then, just a day or two later, I came over the first evidence that the election was rigged. In the middle of the night, in the most strategic swing states, in the most strategic cities, the counting suddenly stopped (after Trump was declared the winner of Florida), something that had never happened before. Trump was leading in all of these states. Then, when the counting suddenly started again, Biden was suddenly leading and ended up as the winner. This was the first example of mathematical impossibilities and statistical anomalies.

Then we could see footage recorded from live TV during the election where votes for Trump suddenly went to Biden (never the other way around).

There was the footage of Ruby Freeman and her daughter after having sent everybody home, pulled out votes from under the table and ran the same vote several times through the same machine (this was when the counting stopped in the middle of the night). When the videos was first shown, a Democrat started yapping like an angry chihuahua, screaming ""that video has been debunked (""debunked"" has become one of the favorite words of Democrats). She was then told it couldn't have been debunked, because it was the first time they showed the video to anyone.

We saw footage of vans arriving in the middle of the nights full of boxes with votes. 

Witnesses and whistleblowers appeared on television where they told how they had crossed the state borders with boxes that were delivered to election center.

Observers were thrown out of the buildings and the windors covered.

There were too many videos on Youtube to see it all, so I clicked ""like"", which I use as a bookmark, so I could see the videos later. Like how people found votes dumped on fields and other places. But all those videos were deleted by Youtube because we were not allowed to question the election. What are they so afraid of if Biden won fair and square?

Then 2000 Mules showed us people dumping stacks of votes in boxes all over the city, using gloves and taking pictures of it to make sure they got paid. And despite what Bill Barr, Wikipedia and the media claims, the movie has NOT been debunked.

Seth Keshel gave further examples on all the impossibilities and anomalies, like how unlikely it was that a candidate who won all the Bellwether states still lost the election.

Can't remember all the experts, but some of them were Dr. Douglas Frank, Patrick Byrne, Mark Levin and Shiva Ayyadurai.

Then there was the evidence of how countless people shared the same address, addresses that were leading to parking lots and empty places, people who lived there that denied they had voted for Biden, people who were told to go home because according to the data, they had already voted, and so on.

Corrupt Judge Amy Totenberg Sealed the Halderman report, preventing anyone to have access to information about voting machines.'

The Maricopa audit concluded that the election should never have been certified. Corrupt media focused only on the recound, pretending they are too stupid to realize that a recount is only the first step in an audit. Of course a recount without an audit will show Biden got the most votes. But that's not what an audit is.

Just to mention some of the examples.

Obviously the voters were furious. They wanted transparency and access to the election data, which the Democrats and RINOs refused to show them. All the MAGA-voters and everybody else who voted for Trump would accept the loss if the evidence showed that he really lost. But nobody has been allowed to see there evidence.

So no, people don't refuse to accept the election outcome because Trump says Biden cheated, because he wants to be the president so bad and can't handle to lose, so he comes up with lies about how he is the real winner but without being able to prove any of it. That's the fake media narrative.

Then came January 6th. I have asked leftists on social media how exactly they think Trump would have grabbed the power if the narrative was true. Either I don't get any replies, or I am told ""it's not my job to educate you"".

Forget the fact that the guards opened the doors for protesters, that so far only one was armed (an FBI plant), and that most just strolled inside the building. Or that police killed two protesters and were beating the crap out of others. How would a few hundred, at most, seize power by simply walking into the congress? What would theìr next step have been? Killing a few politicians they didn't like, then wait for Trump to come walking through the doors, and then Trump would have waited for the phone calls from leaders from all over the world, congratulating him with the unconventional victory and successful insurrection?

Forget the fact that there is video footage of Trump where he tells everybody to don't use any violence. What would have happened if the protesters had killed guards and politicians? The army and soldiers would probably have been sent to DC to shoot or arrest them (the same guards that Trump offered and which Nasty Nancy's office declined), and if Trump was involved, he would have been arrested to.

But the Democrats and RINOs know where was not insurrection attempt. The same with the media. They just pretend they believe it, so they can continue telling lies to the people. There are always some who will believe it (or pretend to, because they have been manipulated to hate Trump and MAGA). It is all political theater.

If it had been an attemped coup, people need to hear the scenario of what would have happened if thes unarmed protesters had gone through with it. Stage 1: Enter the building. Stage 2, 3 and 4? Nobody has mentioned a thing about it, other than how they feared for their life. If all these people wanted to kill, they need to ask themselves why only protesters died.

And media has the nerve to tell it is Trump and MAGA that is the reason people are losing their faith in the election process.

occasions where people have been accused of racism when they have not been racist, yet their whole lively hoods, careers and every ounce of good they’ve done in their life it no longer matters they’re branded as racist proven guilty or not they are tarnished for life. 

** Trigger alert **
 I know some black people sometimes now use the word racist in a situation when the opinion of others is not tailored to their own belief and have used the woes knowing the impact it can have on someone’s whole life the implications of that word are starting to steadily creep up with the power of the N word.

Like if somebody was accused of raping someone then they have been found out to be innocent. There would be repercussions for the person who made the false allegation.

4775,xwazhg,Let's analyze the situation in Europe now that Nordstream 2 is gone for the foreseeable future,"We've had [discussions of the Ukraine war and its broader implications at the outset of the war](https://old.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/t4du3r/america_defeats_germany_for_the_third_time_in_a/hyxv4vw/). Now that the Nordstream 2 pipeline has been sabotaged and it is not clear when or even if it can be repaired the situation has accelerated and changed. It is worthwhile and I would say pressing to come to a clear understanding of what this means. So I'm giving my analysis not as some definitive word but just to have some perspective and to get a discussion going.

First people of course want to know who was behind the sabotage. The European and American imperialists were quick at the draw with an answer: the Russians, and don't you dare suggest it was the US. In the grander scheme of things what is important is the dynamics this can unfold in Europe and indeed globally. But we can at least look at the two main suspects and reason through the qui bono. Before that some context. The pipeline was not just a Russian project, it was primarily a joint project of Russia and Germany with other Europeans both involved and opposed. It was a crucial project for German imperialism to ensure not just constant and cheap energy supply, but to forge a deeper and lasting alliance with Russia. The Eastern Europeans, Ukraine in particular, were opposed to the pipeline because by circumventing these countries they would lose transfer costs they still receive otherwise - for Germany in turn this would have meant even lower energy costs. So this was not simply an attack on Russian infrastructure, it was an attack on German imperialism and Europe at large as it substantially undermines its energy security, thus its independence from the US and the prosperity of its industries.

The reasoning produced by bourgeois media regarding Russia's motivation goes as follows: The Russians have leverage over Europe by means of their supply of resources. They want to use this leverage, but not openly so. Thus they sabotaged their own pipeline to put pressure on Europe, and they blame the US to split the Euro-American alliance. The problem with the reasoning is evident: by blowing up the pipelines the Russians would have blown up their own leverage, not used it, but negated it while also losing customers who are only becoming more desperate for their resources in spite of all the posturing. But even the motivation is questionable, since the West is already in open war with Russia, they are openly supplying arms and funds to Ukraine and [buying out the entire country for decades to come](https://thenextrecession.wordpress.com/2022/08/13/ukraine-the-invasion-of-capital/). Why would the Russians not simply turn off the pipelines openly, or do so again with a thinly veiled pretense as they did with Nordstream 1 so that everyone understands the message, rather than actually blowing it up and destroying their leverage.

The US on the other hand has been rallying against the construction of the pipeline  ever since its was conceived. Why? Because it works towards the creation of one of their biggest geostrategic nightmares, the alliance of Russian resources and German capital and industry which creates a genuine threat to US imperialism. We've all seen the [clips of Biden](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FVbEoZXhCrM) and [Nuland openly announcing that they will find a way to shut down the pipeline](https://detv.us/2022/01/28/victoria-nuland-threatens-to-shut-down-nord-stream-2-if-russia-invades-ukraine-rt-en/) from earlier this year, but the background to these threats are much deeper. NATO itself has as one of its main functions the purpose of [keeping Germany and Russia at arms length](https://www.counterfire.org/articles/history/18584-keep-the-russians-out-the-americans-in-and-the-germans-down-a-potted-and-bloody-history-of-nato). And precisely this was being undermined by the existence of the pipeline, at a time when German industry has already conquered Europe and while the US is in rapid decline. Now that the pipeline is destroyed, so is this danger gone for the immediate future.

This leads me to the larger point. I think to make sense of this whole war we have to be conscious that the US has been preparing for the war against China for almost two decades by now. This is what necessitates the radicalism of US foreign policy. With [Obama's strategic Pivot to Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian_foreign_policy_of_the_Barack_Obama_administration) a new phase in this preparation was started, now the coming conflict informs every move of the US bourgeoisie and their political agents. Prior to the pipeline sabotage I thought the main goal was to lure Russia into the conflict, which ought to internally destabilize it and depose Putin, opening the way for a US comprador who could then [dismantle Russia into a number of helpless small nations](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/russia-putin-colonization-ukraine-chechnya/639428/). Now I'm starting to think the primary target was actually Europe, particularly Germany, not Russia (which remains the a secondary goal).

For some time now there have been efforts to bring industry back to the US. Recently there is [the program of repatriating chip production to the US](https://mronline.org/2022/08/09/u-s-china-chip-war-continues/), but to goal has to be larger in order to prepare for the large scale confrontation with China. And that's where the sabotage of Nordstream 2 pipeline does wonders for the US. It creates a renewed dependence of another imperialist block that was becoming increasingly alienated from the US ever since the creation of the EU. At the same time it destroys the industries of Europe, who now will no longer have the necessary resources to continue production. Even if they change to American natural gas the price will be 7 to 8 fold than that of Russian gas, which would raise the cost of production to a level that might simply be no longer competitive. Indeed [industries have already started](https://www-handelsblatt-com.translate.goog/technik/it-internet/wirtschaftspolitik-deutsche-unternehmen-bauen-ihre-standorte-in-den-usa-immer-weiter-aus-/28697464.html?nlayer=Technologie-News_3684670&_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=de&_x_tr_pto=wapp) moving [from Europe to the US](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/09/europe-faces-an-exodus-of-energy-intensive-industries.html). *So the destruction of European industry works directly in favor of re-industrialization of the US.* [Michael Hudson reckons that Europe has effectively lost an entire decade of development](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/09/michael-hudson-on-the-euro-without-germany.html) due to the destruction of the pipelines. And now that Europe will no longer be competitive nor independent of the US it also is of less use for China, as its living standards falls and thus its potential purpose as a market for complex products will dwindle. Seemingly a success for the US all along the line.

This, btw. was one of the horror visions of Engels. In a letter to Sorge from January 7, 1888 while thinking through a potential world war he considered the option of Europe becoming entwined in a prolonged internal conflict that would lead to US industry overtaking it. In that case Engels saw two options: either Europe would de-industrialize as it would no longer be competitive with US industry and thus become one of the domains of US imperialism, or it would overthrow its bourgeoisie and finally enter into socialist transition. This just as an interesting detail.

To the consequences for the coming development. Europe will fall into a deep and prolonged economic and social crisis. This, of course, heightens the trends towards fascization, likely to a critical degree. The fascists will use the crisis to argue to move away from the US and towards the east (thus isolating the US), they will use it to discredit not just the established bourgeois faction who created this crisis in the first place with its obedience to US dictates, they will use it to discredit bourgeois democracy in its entirety. Certainly a section of the established, US aligned political caste will switch tone and abandon the US. [Merkel, who was one of the last intelligent imperialist politicians of some actual stature, already remarked](https://www.german-foreign-policy.com/news/detail/9040) that Germany shouldn't just give up on Nordstream 2 (it still doesn't seem to be clear if it can be repaired after all). It remains to be seen just how strong bourgeois democracy is in Europe, I would not rule out that it can survive this crisis by coming this close to fascism without actually tipping into it. The other trend that will emerge, I think, is an actual revolutionary left. With the deep and broad impoverishment that this crisis will bring the conditions for such an actual left are finally recreated and much faster than would have happened otherwise. In this sense this terrorist attack by the US on Europe (by US I'm including its proxies, who may have done it for them, [say Poland for example](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/09/the-bornholm-blow-up-repeats-the-bornholm-bash-poland-attacks-germany-and-blames-russia.html)) could well turn out to be a godsend by the American bourgeoisie to the world proletariat. These are the struggles that the left in Europe has to prepare for. They have to make concrete studies of how these tendencies will work themselves out within the context of their given society, how they can affect them in favor of overcoming the bourgeois order.

I know this already got too long for a forum post, but it deserves still much more detailed analysis (I'm cutting it short intentionally so that someone will still read it at all, also because I don't have too much time). Hopefully we can work towards something like it in a discussion. I'm totally open to reasoned disagreements.

E: Almost forgot that I wanted to tag u/TheRedMarxist in this.

E2: Update: [according to fascist German politicians](https://twitter.com/Alice_Weidel/status/1577960036613201920?cxt=HHwWgIC9wd-SheYrAAAA) there's still a functional line of Nordstream 2 and the Russians have offered to supply gas through it. German media aligned with the government coalition (which is close to the entire media) has not reported on this. But this will turn out to be a significant bit of leverage by the German fascists which they can use to push their agenda. [There's already been demonstrations in Germany](https://www-jungewelt-de.translate.goog/artikel/435564.gegen-hohe-energiepreise-wut-in-ostdeutschland.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=de&_x_tr_pto=wapp) with people demanding the government to drop the sanctions on Russia and open Nordstream 2, demonstrations largely lead by fascist forces.

I've also added some more links in case people want to get a more concrete picture (which I'd recommend, of course).

E3: [New source on the still working Nordstream 2 line and the Russian offer](https://www.dw.com/en/putin-offers-europe-gas-through-nord-stream-2-germany-declines/a-63416138 ) (already denied by the Germans, but we'll see as the social pressure mounts). Also mentions that it will take at least one year to repair the pipelines. This is not that long, but I'm not sure how it will influence Russia's actions in the war, if they prolong it with that in sight, speculating that Germans will change course, or if its too long for them. Putin's following suggestion might point to the former option:

> ""We could move the lost volumes from the Nord Streams along the bottom of the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea region and thus make the main routes for the supply of our fuel, our natural gas to Europe through Turkey, creating the largest gas hub for Europe in Turkey,"" 

This has to be read as another offer to Germany in particular, as German capital and politics is intimately entwined with Turkey's comprador bourgeoisie. Ukraine has already suggested destroying the existing Russian pipeline running through Turkey, and there was already one such attempt. I think Russia also doesn't want to fall completely into dependency on China, with the potential of simply becoming its resource colony. By keeping the European connection alive it also maintains political and economic room for maneuverability.

There was also another sabotage attack in Germany, this time on the public transport system. [Here's an analysis](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/10/whose-cat-caught-the-german-tongue-no-blame-for-russia-after-german-train-sabotage-on-sunday-morning-no-blame-for-nord-stream-sabotage-yet.html) which points out two things: (1) German politics is shy on putting the blame for this on Russia so far, and (2) the growing tensions and shifts within the government and German political landscape at large.

And [there was yet another damaged pipeline](https://www.dw.com/en/poland-reports-leak-in-oil-pipeline-to-germany/a-63410763), a Russian crude oil one running through Poland to supply Europe in general and Germany in particular. AfD, the German fascist party, already put the accident in doubt, suggesting it was sabotage. They're probably right, I'd wager, as Poland is the strongest partner of the US in mainland Europe and has obvious historical reasons to hate German imperialism. Poles are suggesting it was once again the Russians sabotaging their own pipeline, naturally.

Finally [this is a bit of a longer piece on the deep economic and social effects of the crises](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/10/protests-are-growing-across-europe-as-inflation-surges-and-economic-crisis-deepens.html), both regarding the energy supply and the inflation. Particularly interesting regarding France and Germany. If you've heard about the gas protests in France, this is some good background to check out.

> Not only is inflation raging but economic activity is grinding to a standstill. Legions of small and medium sized businesses, still shouldering heavy debts after the lockdowns of 2020, are facing an existential crisis.

> [...] **Of greatest concern is the Euro Area’s largest economy, Germany, whose industrial backbone is massively dependent on cheap sources of abundant energy, which no longer exist thanks to the recent rupturing of Nordstream I and II.**

Global Times has an opinion piece on the growing tendencies towards a turn away from the US along with the danger of falling completely under its hegemony (they probably correctly aleardy give up on the UK in this regard). It's called *Europe awakes to US sabotage of its autonomy* and includes this remarkable piece of information:

> In the first eight months of this year, European companies' investment in China surged by 123.7 percent. Many European manufacturing giants continue to bet part of their future on cooperation with China, and they are expressing their attitude toward Europe's China policy with their actions.",-6185281666565838719,0

4777,ypfgoo,Why are liberals obsessed with the glorification of prostitution?,"Communism proposes true liberty in a kantian sense: freedom is wanting to do what you would have to do anyway. Men and women find dignity in the performance of activities for the common good, in LABOUR. Liberals for some reason completely erase the aspect of human dignity, and propose an idea of freedom without limits that does nothing but render you slave of your own vices and alone. There is no room for other people in the individualist liberal universe. This leads to a depressing spectacle of individuals, alone, only bothered with specifying their own identity, their self-representation, the protection of their personal freedoms, with themselves. And we come to the point in which they make us women say that selling our bodies, our intimacy, is not the product of a corrupt and disgusting system, but is actually empowering. To me is actually a good representation of movements under capitalism. Firstly they only fight for the a narrow privileged minority (white middle class sex workers that don’t risk their lives daily), and secondly they somehow convince people that something so clearly humiliating is actually empowering. And the empowerment is the acquisition of capital for an incredibly small portion of sex workers. As a woman I am disgusted. Whenever I say this publicly I am just a bigot. I am not disgusted at the women who do it, I am disgusted at a system that glorifies it.

4789,ynwhax,Was anything happening in Russia during the 50's-60's?,"I'm interested in looking into statistical research on communist nations. As I was looking at a chart on life expectancy in Russia from the mid 1800's's up to modern times (https://www.statista.com/statistics/1041395/life-expectancy-russia-all-time/), I noticed a certain period that I'm curious about. 

One can obviously observe an increasing trend with significant sporadic fluctuations along the way fueled by major political events that led to either the slowing down of the trend, or an immense decrease, e.g. the Russian civil war, WW2, etc. 

After WW2 one can observe a very accelerated and significant increase in life expectancy, yet it's then faced with a very abrupt halt between the late 50's, early 60's, followed by a decrease in life expectancy after Gorbachev's introduction of neoliberal reforms into the nation, which is subsequently followed by an increase again after many years. And from there, we're at present times.

But what was exactly happening in the 50's-60's that led to that initial halt? Was there a major change or a chain of events that signified this stop, or was this trend more of a reflection on the limitations of the medicinal sciences of the times?

**- Terms -** 

* [ The Objective ] - The Object, Practice, Sense, Reality

* ( The Subjective ) - The Form, Theory, Thought, Contemplation

* { The Ideal } - Theology's God, Hegel's World-Spirit, Feuerbach's Aspirations of Man

> Thus, man becomes conscious of himself through the object that reflects his being; man’s self-consciousness is his consciousness of the object. One knows the man by the object that reflects his being; the object lets his being appear to you; the object is his manifest being, his true, objective ego.

[*1841, L Feuerbach, The Essence of Christianity*](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/feuerbach/works/essence/ec01_1.htm)

> the active side, in opposition to materialism, was developed by idealism — but only abstractly, since, of course, idealism does not know real, sensuous activity as such.

Please leave in the comments any questions you would like me to ask Chinese people. Certain questions involving deep knowledge of theory (e.g. what do you think of Trotsky) I will try to ask officials and professors who should theoretically be able to answer. Other questions that do not involve anything complex (what do you think of this controversy reported in Western media?) I will ask normal people. Please do not ask me for personal information. I will not answer.

After spending a bit of time here, my initial impression is that China is indeed a ""third world country"" in every sense of the word. The g7 are put on a pedestal. White people from the G7 are treated like celebrities to varying degrees. The ""rise of xenophobia"" BS you see on the internet is nonsense. Living conditions are similar to other poor countries, the big exceptions are infrastructure and safety, which are better than most countries.

There is immense confusion as regards Marxist theory. I visited a university. The professors are split between bourgeois theory (which is euphemistically referred to as mainstream theory) and Marxist theory (most seem to be supporting the former). Those supporting the former are obviously anti-communists, but for obvious reasons do not directly speak out against the government. I assume that politically they are a mix between ""reformers"" and counter-revolutionaries.

The Marxists (professional academic ones) are eclectic. Karl Marx once said, ""The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e. the class which is the ruling material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectual force."" The leading material and therefore intellectual force today globally is undoubtedly the American bourgeoisie. Universities all around the world (including China) use American textbooks in the social science curriculums. This is already a bit shocking for those who don't know better. What genuinely shocked me was to find Marxists agreeing with and promoting David Harvey, Paul Sweezy, and Modern Monetary Theory (this last one does not even pretend to be Marxist)! I used to think Western Marxism was only of interest to petite-bourgeois academics in the West. I was wrong.

The countries targeted by the G7 in today's world often have reactionary political/economic systems. This leads to confusion among the left (e.g. what should the left's stance be toward the Syrian government?). The confusion stems from the fact that the country's position may be progressive from the standpoint of the global economic system, but the same country can have regressive domestic policies. There is even more confusion regarding China since it is ruled by the CPC.  To be fair, the Chinese people themselves are also confused. Chinese students are confused as to why, despite the fact that their country's official ideology is Marxism-Leninism, anti-Marxist theories are predominant in universities. Knowledge of contemporary imperialism (either in the liberal sense of military aggression or the Leninist sense) is almost non-existent among ordinary people and even party officials. I once met a CPC member who works in government who had never read the Communist Manifesto ( this member had time to study abroad in England however!) Despite this, Xi Jinping in one of his recent journal articles wrote something along the lines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin did not expect that we would have to manage a socialist market...We are still revolutionaries and must uphold our revolutionary tradition. Propaganda that supports socialism is also everywhere. Occasionally I even hear on the street a siren reminding people to remember socialist values.

Unfortunately, it has been my experience that anybody critical towards the CPC leans towards liberalism. Many of these people are confused as opposed to being genuine reactionaries. When I start explaining basic Marxist concepts to them, they are instantly fully supportive (in contradistinction to many Westerners who are taught to despise communism).

Finally, I will say that our situation objectively right now is not great. Since the fall of the USSR (arguably since the late 1950s), the global left has been theoretically confused and pessimistic about the future. China is not an exception to this rule. It is my hope that the young generation can make the final push towards human liberation. Anyone who has anything positive to say about developments in other countries please leave it in the comments.

If you didn't know, this was the first time in almost 100 years that geographically separated Palestinians mass participated in a general strike together.

4842,y9epgr,My argument against electoralism/voting,"My case against electoralism/voting.

I've seen a rise in electoralism in leftist spaces in recent times, I think no doubt to people like Contra et al, but I'd like to state a few reasons for why the whole electoral game is bankrupt due to scale and inherent contradictions.



1. It requires enormous energy and investment to win.

Voting isn't simply about the individual votes, on the scale of a national or regional election you're talking thousands if not millions of votes. That's why parties instead focus more on the voting blocks to garner support. For this you need a lot of time and money and labour to succeed and get your candidate in the running. In other words you need a very well organised and costly campaign that may not necessarily succeed.

Socialists should not be looking towards entering this system that is very susceptible to corruption, opportunism, and inefficiencies over time. Rather invest their labour and money in other direct action ventures that can challenge the system and maybe by a secondary measure influence electoral politics. The ultimate truth of electoralism is 'If you don't CAMPAIGN, you can't COMPLAIN' because in order for the candidate to get ANYWHERE there needs to be lots of funding and organising behind it to get a mass group of people voting for you. And for that, it requires you engage in that campaign to make it work, not JUST VOTE.



2. Social change comes from the societal conditions first and foremost.

People often state that the more left wing candidate will be able to be more effective when it comes to workers rights and change. Yet as we can see throughout history this was more due to the circumstances involved. The New Deal came in response to the crashed economy, the post war reforms in the UK were held by both parties, there was far greater organised labour to bargain, and many repressed groups were also fighting for their say in the nation's affairs.

The rise of Reagan and Thatcher was a response to the downturn in the economy and a need for reshuffling in order to sustain profiteering into the future.  

It’s not to say that history is deterministic, but that the change doesn’t occur at electorate level, it's always driven by much larger factors. Gay marriage, The renters reform bill, and even ACORN UK all came about, or were funded  by initiatives from… a tory government. And now it appears like they're on the way out.

3. The goals and aims of the left are not the same as the right.

The right-wings gains from electoralism are always used as a reason for why the left should engage more with electoral politics and win elections, if they can do it, so should we.

Ignoring what I said in part 1, or that we don't have as much money, lets also remember that the instrument that sustains the system, will not be very effective as a means to destroy it. The right can always lean on the status quo ante and bolster it, the left on the other hand has the much harder job of destroying the very roots of that system. Part of why the left is so divided is because everyone has different ideas about how to go about this and what society should look like, the right already has the foundations of that set firmly, it just needs to retreat to them, hence they tend to get along without too many arguments.

4. It creates opportunism and stagnation.

People might think that a more left centre politician might create a greater avenue for making change, however often the electoral game simply co-opts and recuperates these issues.

Roe vs Wade being overturned for example allows the perfect opportunity for Democrats to bring people into the political game and give themselves a career boost. In other words, the injustice becomes an opportunity, in the same way that many charities depend upon the problems they intend to solve in order to exist.

Similarly, having a strong Conservative party allows the Scottish National Party to scapegoat their problems onto them. If Scotland were independent that would be much harder to do. I'm not saying that's the reason they don't attempt an independence referendum again, but its understandable to see why they wouldn't attempt to remove all doubt, especially when you notice what happened to the Liberal Democrats when they shared power.

It's easy to see why if a left-wing politician were to gain power that the situation would simply become a matter of them sustaining power whilst implementing small reforms here and there, whilst beating off more radical groups and energies that wish to go further.



5. It destroys the focus on the left from radical aims into a door-to-door canvasing endeavour.

I'll just let Libcom explain this better than I can.

 Every criticism of 'abolish the family' as a slogan imagines the socialist as stranger, no connection to their listener who has little/no prior knowledge and disengages when they hear something they don't like (rather than ask Qs): this is the doorstep socialism of electoralism 

 Might these be conversations with friends/workmates? Long term relationships where people say ""well, they might be a mad bastard but not all wrong""? No, just ""what would they say if I knocked the door and said 'I'm campaigning for X; how do you feel about abolishing the family'?"" 

 This is politics imagined as an elevator pitch: if you don't immediately say what the stranger wants to hear, they'll close the door on you. If that's your politics, ok; but that's not the end of socialist ideas (let alone activity!) 

 Point is, if you have radical politics, you're always gonna be a bit of an outlier. But the point of socialism/communism/whatever politics is to build relationships & your non-politico mates/workmates (fuck, even your fellow activists!) don't have to swallow your worldview whole   



6. It's not as simple as 'Do both'

The argument that 'WE CAN DO BOTH' is complicated by the fact that its always weighted on the reformist side.

A line has emerged in recent times - ""Do radical actions WHEN they come about, Do reform IN THE MEANTIME"" which is probably one of the more impoverished statements I've ever heard.

If we actually want to move things forward we have to create the circumstances for those radical actions, and perhaps do reform as a side activity if it is clear and convenient (referendums). So the statement should be ""Do reform WHEN things come about, Do Radical Actions IN THE MEAN TIME!""


What I will say though is that voter apathy only works if that apathy is being funnelled into a different channel, Not voting alone doesn't change the system either. So other avenues need to be created in order for that to work. The problem is people simply insist ""Oh we don't have those yet"" which becomes a self-fulfilling philosophy that basically amounts to ""We won't ever have them"" because such people are not interested in developing the bases in the first place... because they don't exist.",-8497213661322507460,0

I remember reading I believe in the first part of Zhukov’s autobiography that the USSR had always refused dividing up the world with the Nazis so they had turned to the British and what have you, but this pact suggests otherwise, how do other ML’s understand this pact and deal with it? Basically the pact was offered by the Nazis for the USSR to become a fourth axis power and be allowed a sphere of influence from the Middle East to India and Asia. It was turned down outright and Molotov spent a couple of days in Berlin negotiating and ultimately the Germans didn’t accept the counter offer of the USSR maintaining influence in Europe and at the end refused to respond to the USSR despite being asked several times. Throughout Soviet times the common narrative was that Stalin was testing the Germans and there was a publication that’s said to have been edited by Stalin himself saying as much until 1991.

Any evidence for this? I don't think so. Plenty evidence that the West has antagonised and humiliated Russia since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Broken promises regarding NATO's expansion eastward, and seeking to confine Russia geopolitically to the point where they strangle them. Why should Russia accept a western NATO backed government in Kyiv, armed to the teeth? Would the United States accept North Korean or Russian jets and weaponry in Mexico? 

All this imperialism narrative serves to do is to make Putin (who is no doubt an oligarch and thug) into a cartoon Hitler 2.0 and absolve the West of complicity in their antagonism. NATO  has been training Ukrainian troops by the thousands since 2014. Ukraine has permitted fascists to march on their streets, supported by local officials. They have attacked civilians in the Donbass. Yet, now they are the darlings of the west.

And what of the humanitarian crises? Does the West care at all to that end? Instead of calling for a ceasefire and immediate pause to the fighting, they continue their war mongering. Big win for the military industrial complex no doubt. 

Do I agree with the invasion? No. It's an illegal invasion. But I don't for one minute buy that Putin is an imperialist nor the NATO is benevolent in its intentions with Ukraine.

4861,y3lm22,Stalin and Lenin arguing against the idea that capitalism will collapse on its own,"From Stalin's [Report to the Seventeenth Party Congress on the Work of the Central Committee of the C.P.S.U.(B.)](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1934/01/26.htm):

> But while the bourgeoisie chooses the path of war, the working class in the capitalist countries, brought to despair by four years of crisis and unemployment, is beginning to take the path of revolution. This means that a revolutionary crisis is maturing and will continue to mature. And the more the bourgeoisie becomes entangled in its war schemes, the more frequently it resorts to terrorist methods of fighting against the working class and the labouring peasantry, the more rapidly will the revolutionary crisis develop.

> Some comrades think that, once there is a revolutionary crisis, the bourgeoisie is bound to get into a hopeless position, that its end is therefore a foregone conclusion, that the victory of the revolution is thus assured, and that all they have to do is to wait for the fall of the bourgeoisie and to draw up victorious resolutions. That is a profound mistake. The victory of the revolution never comes of itself. It must be prepared for and won. And only a strong proletarian revolutionary party can prepare for and win victory. Moments occur when the situation is revolutionary, when the rule of the bourgeoisie is shaken to its very foundations, and yet the victory of the revolution does not come, because there is no revolutionary party of the proletariat with sufficient strength and prestige to lead the masses and to take power. It would be unwise to believe that such ""cases"" cannot occur.

> It is worth while in this connection to recall Lenin's prophetic words on revolutionary crisis, uttered at the Second Congress of the Communist International:

> > ""We have now come to the question of the revolutionary crisis as the basis of our revolutionary action. And here we must first of all note two widespread errors. On the one hand, the bourgeois economists depict this crisis as mere ‘unrest,' as the English so elegantly express it. On the other hand, revolutionaries sometimes try to prove that the crisis is absolutely hopeless. That is a mistake. There is no such thing as an absolutely hopeless situation. The bourgeoisie behaves like an arrogant plunderer who has lost his head; it commits folly after folly, making the situation more acute and hastening its own doom. All this is true. But it cannot be ‘proved' that there is absolutely no chance of its gulling some minority of the exploited with some kind of minor concessions, or of suppressing some movement or uprising of some section or another of the oppressed and exploited. To try to ‘prove' beforehand that a situation is ‘absolutely' hopeless would be sheer pedantry, or juggling with concepts and catchwords. In this and similar questions the only real ‘proof' is practice. The bourgeois system all over the world is experiencing a most profound revolutionary crisis. The revolutionary parties must now ‘prove' by their practical actions that they are sufficiently intelligent and organised, are sufficiently in contact with the exploited masses, are sufficiently determined and skilful, to utilise this crisis for a successful and victorious revolution"" (Lenin, Vol. XXV, pp. 340-41).

I thought it could be worthwhile bringing this up again because there's a certain fatalism about this new structural crisis of the capitalist world system taking a hold among the left, I get the impression. Faced with the lack of any substantially organized revolutionary left in the imperialist countries some seek refuge in the illusion that capitalism will just collapse on its own. Theories of capitalism's final collapse like Luxemburg's and Grossmann's are becoming more popular among intellectuals, which I'd say is an expression of this weakness, where the theory then serves as a means to alleviate the pain of this terrible situation or actually mystify it into a strength. In this sense it is worth pointing out that both Luxemburg and Grossmann also understood their theories not as arguments for fatalism, but as arguments for why the working class has to become organized and prevent this final collapse, which would hurt the oppressed and exploited people the most.",-6185281666565838719,0

Well, at least I hope that I got that right. Feel free to correct me.

As far as I know, the most successful and famous movements that are considered as Maoist, or at least influenced by MLM (such as Shining Path, Naxalites or The Unified Communist Party of Nepal -or Chinese Revolution itself) belong to rural settings, instead of more urbanized and industrialized settings that are still situated amidst imperialism. (I'm from Turkey, a Middle-Eastern country which has extremely violent inner contradictions) Reactionary academy brushes these concerns off by saying that Maoism (or MLM, in that matter) is basically ""Marxism-Leninism adapted to agrarian conditions"", which strikes me as an incredibly crude depiction. But still, history, or my lack of knowledge, doesn't give me a hand in refuting those claims.

about the protests

ده روز است که بسیاری از شهرهای ایران به صحنه ی رودرروئی، اعتراض و فریاد مردم تحت ستم ایران بدل گشته است. قتل ژینا امینی که احساسات همه مردم ایران را جریحه دار کرد جرقه ای بود که خشم و اعتراض فرو خفته توده های مردم علیه ستمهای انباشته ی این چهل و سه ساله که جمهوری اسلامی به مردم ایران و مشخصا زنان اعمال کرده را فروزان کرد. ستمهای انباشته ای که ستم بر زنان یکی از مهمترین این ستم ها است. ستمی که پتانسیل عظیمی در مبارزه برای سرنگونی جمهوری اسلامی در خود نهفته دارد. چرا که لغو حجاب به مثابه نماد اسلام سیاسی نه تنها در ایران بلکه در منطقه، به زیر کشیدن قدرت اسلام سیاسی را هدف گرفته است. جنبش اسلام سیاسی که نه تنها برای حاکمیت سرمایه داران در ایران، بلکه برای همدستان این رژیم جنایتکار یعنی شرکای امپریالیست از ابتدای به سرکار آمدنش و تا همین الان هم، کارکردی حیاتی دارد. روشن است آن سیستمی که ستم برزنان را نه تنها در ایران بلکه در سراسر جهان تولید و بازتولید می کند، سیستمی است که در آن روابط کالایی سرمایه دارانه حاکم است. اما دولت های امپریالیستی بیش از چند دهه است با حمایت و یا روی کار آوردن حکومت های اسلامی در برخی از کشورها مانند ایران توانسته اند جنبش اجتماعی و مترقی را نه تنها در یک کشور بلکه در منطقه مورد تعرض قرار دهند. البته این تعرض پی در پی به حقوق زنان اگرچه هیچگاه از جانب انسانهای آزاده و زنان بی جواب نمانده است، اما بهرحال حاکمیت سرمایه داران اسلامی چهار دهه است که در قدرت هستند و برای ماندن در قدرت از هیچ جنایتی فروگذار نکرده اند.

این روزها به گلوله بستن زنان و جوانان در کف خیابان، نشان می دهد که حاکمیت در ایران هم می داند به زیر کشیدن و آتش زدن روسری یک تعرض قدرتمند سیاسی ایدئولوژیک به یکی از پایه های حاکمیت جمهوری اسلامی است. سران رژیم می دانند که این تعرض ایدئولوژیک، مبارزه برای سرنگونی انقلابی جمهوری اسلامی را وارد فصل تازه ای می کند.

طرح اینترنت ماهواره ای که گویا ایلان ماسک میلیاردر آمریکایی با هماهنگی وزارت خزانه داری آمریکا در اختیار مردم ایران قرار داده است، نشان می دهد که خطر سرنگونی رژیم هم برای امپریالیستهایی که منافع مشترک دارند هشدار دهنده است، و تلاش آنها این است تا آنجا که ممکن است خود را حامی این خیزش جلوه دهند و در بزنگاه مشخص برای آلترناتیوی که منافعشان را تامین می کند وارد عمل شوند. البته آلترناتیو سازی امپریالیستها امر تازه ای نیست هم اکنون هم رضا پهلوی، شورای مدیریت گذار و بخش های مختلف اپوزیسیون بورژوایی هم دندان تیز کرده اند که به هرشکلی که می توانند سهمی در آینده ایران داشته باشند. از این رو برای مردم تحت ستم ایران، کارگران و زحمتکشان، به حاشیه رانده شدگان و مخصوصا زنان تصویری روشن از آلترناتیو حکومتی برای آینده ی ایران به همان اندازه ی خیزشی که اکنون جانانه و با شجاعت به پیش می برند، ضروری و حیاتی است. قیام 57 و از کف رفتن این فرصت تاریخی برای مردم ایران، نشان داد که آمادگی برای کسب قدرت سیاسی تا چه اندازه اهمیت دارد. این آمادگی در تمام عرصه ها باید به شکلی سازمان داده شود که زنان، کارگران و زحمتکشان و تهیدستان شهری، اقلیتهای تحت ستم جوانان، بیکاران و….مطمئن شوند در هر شرایطی منافع آنها تأمین می گردد و از طریق شوراها و دیگر نهادهای حاکمیت توده ای قدرت واقعی را در اختیار خواهند داشت.

بدون تردید توده ای شدن حضور مردم در کف خیابان  می تواند جامعه ی جهانی را تحت تاثیر قرار داده و باردیگر انسانهای مترقی و آزادیخواه را در کشورهای مختلف در همبستگی به خود به خیابان بکشاند و پایه های جمهوری اسلامی را بلرزاند. برای پیشروی این خیزش سراسری لازم است افق انقلابی و روشنی پیش روی آن قرار گیرد. اگر به زمین افکندن و سوزاندن روسری ها اسلام سیاسی یعنی یکی از پایه های ایدئولوژیک حاکمیت جمهوری اسلامی را مورد تعرض قرار می دهد، اما نباید از این غافل باشیم که پایه اصلی حاکمیت جمهوری اسلامی نظام طبقاتی سرمایه داری است. رژیم جمهوری اسلامی با تکیه بر این نظام طبقاتی است که ستمکشی بر زنان و کارگران و ستمدیدگان را تولید و بازتولید می کند. بنابراین گستراندن افق رهائی بخش سوسیالیستی از پیش شرط های پیشروی  خیزش سراسری جاری است. از دیگر پیش شرط های پیشروی خیزش مهسا هر چه توده ای تر شدن و سراسری تر شدن و به میدان آمدن طبقه کارگر در ابعاد اجتماعی است. با هر چه توده ای تر شدن این خیزش و به میدان آمدن طبقه کارگر با اعتصابات سراسری است که نیروهای سرکوبگر دشمن فلج و زمینگیر می شوند.

با گستراندن افق روشن سوسیالیستی است که آن دسته از بدیل ها که می خواهند یک رژیم دمکراتیک اسلامی، یا مشروطه سلطنتی یا یک استبداد سرمایه داری غیر مذهبی لائیک جایگزین رژیم جمهوری اسلامی کنند به حاشیه رانده می شوند. آن دسته از  آلترناتیوهایی که فقط  مذهبی بودن حکومت فعلی را به چالش می کشند و صرفا با سیستم های لائیک تأکید می کنند مانع پیشروی جنبش آزادیخواهانه در ایران می شوند. بنابراین شعارهایی مانند “مرگ بر دیکتاتور”، “مرگ بر ستمگر چه شاه باشه چه رهبر” ، “نان کار آزادی” در ادامه لازم است خود را در ارائه بدیلی که رهائی از هر نوع مناسباتی که دیکتاتوری را باز تولید می کند، رهائی از هر نوع مناسباتی که نان و کار و آزادی انسانها را به گرو می گیرد و تحقق واقعی آزادی را تضمین کند، نشان دهد. چنین بدیلی نمی تواند چیزی جز بدیل سوسیالیستی باشد.

آلترناتیو سوسیالیستی در مسیر پیشروی خود در جریان مبارزه، شوراها ارگان حاکمیت کارگران و زحمتکشان و مدیریت جامعه را شکل می دهد، در گام نخست رژیم جمهوری اسلامی را سرنگون می کند. ماشین دولتی موجود را همراه با کلیه ی ارگانهای سرکوب آن درهم می شکند و حکومت شوراها را برقرار می سازد. حکومت شورائی وسیع ترین آزادی های بدون قید و شرط سیاسی را تأمین و تضمین می نماید. با اجتماعی کردن مالکیت بر وسائل تولید، همه ظرفیتهای اقتصادی و اجتماعی موجود در جامعه ایران را با برنامه و نقشه مند، به کار می گیرد. رفع نیازهای مردم، تأمین زندگی مرفه و شایسته انسان به هدف تولید تبدیل می شود. بدین ترتیب شکوفائی و توسعه اقتصادی واقعی ممکن می گردد ، بازده كار با سرعتى غیر قابل تصور افزایش خواهد یافت، خدمات و محصولات مورد نیاز مردم در مقیاس انبوه برای رفع نیازهای مادی و معنوی انسانها تولیدمی شوند. مردم از امکانات یکسان و فراوان برای رشد استعداد و توانائی های فردی برخوردار خواهند بود و توانائی های فردی شکوفا میشوند.

در نظام اجتماعی سوسیالیستی پیشرفت های علمی و تکنولوژیک امکان پایین آوردن ساعات کار و افزایش ساعات فراغت را فراهم می آورد. جامعه سوسیالیستی نابرابریها و تبعیض ها یی نظیر ستمکشی زن و ستمگری ملی و مذهبی را ریشه کن می شوند. تبعیض جنسیتی و تنگ نظری ملی و نژادی جای خود را به همبستگی انسانی خواهد داد. سوسیالیسم به تخریب و فجایع زیست محیطی که هستی، امنیت و رفاه انسان ها را به مخاطره انداخته اند پایان می دهد و حفاظت و بهره برداری عقلانی از طبیعت را به معیار اصلی پیشرفت و توسعه خود تبدیل می کند. تحقق چنین جامعه ای، خیال پردازی و تصور مدینه فاضله آرمانی نیست. حرکتی در سیر تحول مادی تاریخ بشر است. نیروی اجتماعی آن در قامت اعتراضات و اعتصابات باشکوه کارگران، اعتراضات و خیزش های تهیدستان شهری و زنان آزاده در صحنه حضور دارد و امکانات مادی تحقق آن وجود دارد. اما برای ارتقای سازمانیابی این نیروی اجتماعی، برای برپایی یک جنبش شورایی و برای برقراری سوسیالیسم باید آستین ها را بالا زد.

I've seen so many people, specially communists, to try to defend this war by saying that Ukraine has fascist paramilitary groups, that Ukraine is banning communist and leftist parties, that Russia is simmilar to URSS... While it's true that Ukraine has a long history of banning communist ideas and idolizing fascist groups, and I really condemn that, I feel that what we are expiriencing is an intrusion of leftist ideas among communist lines.

What really is happening in Ukraine was already explained by Lenin, this war is only part of the imperialist phase of late capitalism, in which superpowers dispute resources and power, such as USA, UE, China, and Russia. And in that context, what we should focus is what organizations are gaining power, and who are the ones that are losing here. For me it is clear that the only side we as communist should take is the people's side, fighting along the proletarians to end the war, not to participating in it, because is the people that is suffering the consecuences of the war (inflation, prices rising, energy deficit) only so superpowers can achieve higher benefits. But also, it is clear to me that the one organization orchestrating everything and gaining more power is the NATO. And even if many communist parties are speaking against it, i feel like the general sense is overlooking this, and many communist not affiliated to a party as well.

Discussions of sexual morality aren't uncommon among women and LGBT people, so I've been curious about how this was handled under previous socialist states, such the USSR or the GDR. This is a broad subject so I'll break it down into separate questions:

1. Engels talks about how socialism will truly realize monogamy. Was there any attempt in carrying this out, and if so, how? Did it ""just"" revolve around improving the economic conditions of women or were there targeted attempts at suppressing non-monogamy (whether it'd be casual sex or downright infidelity/cheating)? Not that I think the KGB were invading people's bedrooms or whatever but perhaps promoting monogamy in other ways (ie, through art)

2. In the 60s/70s, the first world had the sexual revolution, as well as the feminist criticism of this (the feminist sex wars). Did any of this reach the socialist states? 

3. Did socialist states draw any distinction between pornography and nudity/sexuality in art? (as some western feminists did, such as the pornography/erotica distinction)

4. For the time periods in which homosexuality was illegal, was there any pushback? If so, was this pushback progressive or the result of capitalist influences?

5. Is the book *Why Women Had Better Sex Under Socialism* a good read? I've seen it commonly recommended among leftist women (I'm aware of how vague that term is), but I have to pay money to read it.",-2127868491529974154,0

What methods have you used to successfully struggle line with comrades in your group?

My reason for asking is that seems a common thread between my real life experiences and the summations of the different Red Guards groups in the US. It is addressed [in the Tampa Maoist Collective summation](https://tampamaoistcollective.wordpress.com/2018/03/22/the-tampa-maoist-collective-year-summation-if-you-dont-dare-to-struggle-you-dont-deserve-to-win/) and [in the Red Guards Austin response](https://redguardsaustin.wordpress.com/2018/04/04/a-critical-reading-of-the-tampa-summation/) as well. RGA also notes mental health [in this update from their cadre school](https://redguardsaustin.wordpress.com/2016/07/20/update-from-cadre-school/) when it comes to building discipline. I quote the relevant passage:

>The second hurtle is developing a structured and disciplined lifestyle. This is done through always trying to be better organized and paying close attention to morale and enthusiasm, which includes being there for those struggling and uniting around bringing them up. Capitalist society is selfish and self-indulgent and it does not foster good collective responsibilities – it discourages such support. Discipline is essential to the communist organization but it must never be arbitrarily enforced at the expense of comrades’ mental health. Discipline itself has to be constructed through the destruction of our individualism and this has to be done with great care for the well-being of comrades. Discipline when maintained the correct way should be understood as something that makes us stronger, healthier, and more united. It should have an overall positive effect on all who have attained acceptable levels of organizational as well as personal discipline.

>One of the ways in which this is accomplished is through cutting out the excess, getting rid of the cloudy bullshit that fucks us up or makes us complacent. This is what we mean by plain living and arduous struggle. In order to provide all the basic necessities for one another we must often cut out what is not as important, and reject things that discourage struggling with the people and encourage laying about. It includes physical activity, exercise, healthy diets, and most importantly, comradely support. To be the most effective at our task we all feel that higher levels of discipline and struggle are needed than we experienced in our former lives. All of these principles should be accomplished through working together and being patient with one another, and never through commandments or mandates. This too will be uneven and people will always go back and forth, this must be understood as a struggle with many setbacks, but a struggle that is worth it. We have seen the discipline and commitment rise sharply in ourselves as well as those in attendance through such a project. As communists we do not believe in perfection, we believe in motion – in transformation.

A lot of what I see in the above writings resonates with me. Especially since I am neurodivergent myself. Unfortunately the advice given by RGA seems to be either impractical monasticism or vague abstractions. I hope to elucidate what exactly is ""comradely support"" by listening to your experiences as well.

It is apparent that mentally ill/neurodivergent folks are out there, see the problems of capitalist society, and want to organize against them (be that by starting/joining collectives or by joining the PSL/CPUSA/What have you). It seems to me that mentally ill/neurodivergent people are increasingly becoming active (to be very vulgar regarding the history of capitalism, disability, and mental illness), and thus that communists need to figure out how to engage with and integrate these people into the movement/party/organization.

My goal with this post is not to construct some sort of definitive final answer to this challenge. My goal is rather practical; at the lowest levels of organization, what practices have you introduced into your organization that allowed the mentally ill/neurodivergent comrades to not only participate, but to build up their ability to become better communists?

Of course, maybe your organization made some decisions which were counter-productive or harmful. I am open to those experiences as well if you'd like to share them.

If you have no comment but know of some helpful readings/writings/documents, please post. I am interested in those as well.

As you can tell from the title, my primary interest is line struggle. From my own experience, it is easy for me to fall into dogmatic thinking in an effort to make the anxious feelings go away when being criticized. I also have a tendency to acquiesce without investigation or confrontation. 

For example, a comrade and I were discussing Black Nationalism before a meeting once. I remember that he was very aggressive in pushing his line and I never felt like I had the opportunity to speak. My hands started shaking and I became very fidgety. When I had the opportunity to speak, I couldn't focus and expounded an absolute butchery of ""Marxism and the National Question"". My comrade began to speak again and my anxiety spiked, at that point I just wanted the interaction to be over so I told him he was right and I was wrong (this is what he wanted to hear). Once he was sure he ""won"" the debate we were able to get on with the meeting. Now that I think about it, this is pattern of behaviour I have been subject to by this individual and some others.

To remedy this I need to ""take care of myself"" which means having the discipline to take the proper medications and do the therapy/whatever I need to do. This is related but separate from the organizational question. And it doesn't really help define the boundaries between always arguing with people over line and never struggling with them (cowering fearfully away from struggle).

Here are some things I have tried or have seen others try within organizations;

* Creating specific times and places for line struggle to happen. For example, creating a theoretical journal/zine or limiting line struggle to certain in-person meetings. I think the reasoning here is that folks can contribute within their means intellectually while also having the distance they need to function ""normally"" whatever that means.
* Discouraging mentally ill and neurodivergent comrades from fixating on socially media (don't be terminally online).
* Allowing mentally ill and neurodivergent comrades some way to indicate that they are not OK to talk to. For example, if a comrade is having a panic attack or otherwise is not fit to engage in conversation then they can hold up a flag or a red/yellow/green card to visually indicate their status. I think this was helpful for non-verbal comrades but haven't done a systemic analysis.
* starting mental health support groups that are explicitly communist. From what I have seen these have mostly existed in social media, so I don't really have that much experience with them and don't really understand how/if it relates to line struggle.

I am not recommending or advocating for the above practices, its just what i have seen. I'm not even sure I have the experience to evaluate them properly. But maybe you've seen similar and have your own thoughts and experiences. I hope to use your comments to further my own understanding of how to practically tackle this issue and to point me in the right direction as to what might be helpful in my own organizing efforts.",8774529320587318789,0
4933,xhz3b9,"Have any comrades here read ""Black Marxism"" by Cedric Robinson? I'd love to chat about it.","I completed reading ""Black Marxism"" by Cedric Robinson a couple of days ago and I've been really thinking about it a lot since. 

I'm a bit torn and unsure about how, exactly, I feel about the book. On the one hand, I thought it provided some great insight on the labor movement and trade unionism in the US and all that was *not* done by Communists back then to really grapple with racism and, in turn, the black worker. On the other hand, it felt as though Robinson was more than a little hostile towards Marx and Lenin. But perhaps I misread. Criticism is of course fine, but it did seem like a lot of it for a book called Black Marxism. 

I think the most intriguing part of the book was his section on W.E.B DuBois who I admittedly didn't *fully* know about in terms of his skepticism of Leninism and the vanguard party model and his writings generally on the topic of Marx and Marxism.

4940,xfgzlt,The Market Under Socialism,"The concept of market socialism is riddled with contradictions. First and foremost, although all actually existing socialist countries have permitted limited and regulated market activities - to different degrees, at different times - the market was always subordinated to the overall economic plan of socialist development. Further, the existence of markets were always understood to be temporary, and were grudgingly accepted by communists as an undesirable necessity at best. Lenin, Stalin, Mao and Fidel all expressed the necessity of limited markets, particularly during the initial stages of socialist construction, but at the same time emphasized the potential risks and dangers in allowing market activities to flourish unhindered or without the aim of their eventual extinction under communism. This is because markets are rooted in private property and tend to exacerbate and reinforce class divisions and petty bourgeois consciousness. 

Due to the conditions of underdevelopment which plagued all actually existing socialist societies, limited markets were recognized as an invigorating and dynamic force in the process of development. However, it was taken for granted, perhaps naively, that the superiority of socialist enterprises would inevitably surpass and extinguish private enterprises after a certain period of time. In both the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, various attempts were made to eliminate virtually all market activities at different points, but material conditions and intense political struggles eventually compelled the revolutionary authorities to curtail and partially reverse such dictates. Thus even after the collectivization of agriculture enforced by Stalin in the USSR farmers were permitted to cultivate their own small personal plots and sell their surplus in state sanctioned rural markets. Similarly, after a premature and economically unviable attempt to abolish markets in China during the Great Leap Forward, rural markets and limited private enterprise were restored and tolerated, even during the Cultural Revolution. However, at all times, Stalin and Mao both sought to find ways to surpass and transcend the market.b

The collectivization of agriculture was in fact conceived to be a process that aimed to supplant private petty agriculture with a socialist form of production. In the USSR this was done with great haste, leading arguably to a very brutal civil war in the countryside. The antagonisms and disruptions caused by this forced collectivization imposed by the Soviet state led to intense and violent resistance on the part of the kulaks (rich peasants) and segments of the middle peasantry, which in turn compelled the lower peasants and the Soviet government to respond with repressive methods and violence to enforce collectivization. It took at least three years to finally stabilize the situation and consolidate collective farming, with the government ultimately conceding that collective farmers be allowed to retain small individual plots and periodic rural markets. However, what is decisive is that the collective form of agricultural production became predominant with private farming and limited markets being rendered completely subordinate and secondary. This was widely hailed as a victory for socialism. 

In the case of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Communist Party was afforded the advantage of hindsight and was therefore able to analyze and learn from both the successes and failures of collectivization in the Soviet Union. Thus the Chinese government adopted a much more flexible and incremental approach to the collectivization of agriculture, avoiding the violent class atagonisms that plagued the Soviet experience. Rather than imposing full scale collectivization on the peasantry in one heavy handed stroke, the Chinese Communist Party adopted a more dialectical approach by transitioning to collectivization through several stages. First peasants were called upon to form mutual aid teams at the local level, which would begin to introduce cooperative labor and the sharing of tools into the rural production process. These mutual aid teams were encouraged to expand in size and scale, eventually becoming lower stage cooperatives incorporating several villages. As the lower stage cooperatives began to consolidate, increase production, and slowly develop the local economy, a solid material basis was laid to advance to higher stage cooperatives that further expanded and stengthened collectivization in the countryside. This process continued through much contradiction, struggle and experimentation until it culminated in a new fully socialist form of social organization and agricultural production: the People's Communes. The People's Communes were conceived to be relatively autonomous and self-reliant politico-economic organs of the socialist state.",7661539965321682081,0

4980,x49664,What are the contributions to a Marxist Theory of Interpersonal Violence and Coercion?,"For a while, I have been ruminating on my own understanding of (the roots of and mechanics of) interpersonal violence and coercion but I struggle with the reluctant feeling that my understanding of these matters rely on paradigms that are not rooted in Marxism itself (e.g. intersectionality, privilege theory, feminism, liberal psychology).

Therefore, I was wondering if any one else is more knowledge on the existence or development of Marxist understanding of interpersonal violence (e.g. domestic abuse, sexual violence, bullying) and coercion (i.e. forcing someone to do a certain thing when that certain thing is something the coerced people would preferably not do if given the actual freedom). Basically, what, according to a Marxian framework, explains why people across genders and age groups commit to abusive practices against their fellow person (in the context of both perpetrator and victim belong to the same class or of a similar economic and social mode of living)? What kind of dehumanisations are at play, and why? What are the dynamics of coercion? What makes a person submit to coercion? What does that say about people submitting themselves to coercion or violence from a Marxist standpoint?

The reason why I bring up coercion is because it arguably plays an important component in the overall experience of interpersonal violence, but also for the fact that coercion has been historically present within the revolutionary communist movement--in the sense of the bourgeoisie and its armed forces using all sorts of coercive measurements to subdue if not render revolutionaries submitted to their whims. And given the mixed reception Portuguese Maoists experienced after succumbing to torture under the Estado Novo regime (see: [To Talk or Not to Talk: Silence, Torture, and Politics in the Portuguese Dictatorship of Estado Novo](https://eg.uc.pt/bitstream/10316/43508/1/To%20talk%20or%20not%20to%20talk.pdf) by Miguel Cardina), it made me wonder if historically Marxists conceive of (certain forms of) 'submission in response to coercion' as being a sign of petit-bourgeois weakness, which furthermore raises even more questions but I digress.",-6725490223784666827,0
4981,x3uav9,WE REPUDIATE THE ATTEMPTED ATTACK AGAINST THE VICE-PRESIDENT | Liberation Party,"[translated from Spanish]

The Liberation Party (PL) repudiates the attempted attack against Vice President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and expresses its solidarity with her.
Regardless of who is the material author of that attempt to shoot her with a firearm, those responsible ideologically are Macri, Bullrich, Rodríguez Larreta and other reactionary and violent members of Together for Change and ""Libertarians"" who now claim to ask for the clarification of the fact and some even say they sympathize with Cristina.
We agree with Hebe de Bonafini in requesting the resignation of the useless Security Minister Aníbal Fernández, whose Federal Police was supposed to guard the vice president.
What happened on September 1 is a very serious event, as was prosecutor Luciani's request on August 22 for a 12-year prison sentence and lifelong disqualification for Cristina for corruption charges that the prosecutor could not prove.
Both facts are very serious. The attempted attack must be investigated and clarified. And all those responsible and instigators punished.
The Luciani thing requires a total change of the oligarchic justice that this FDT government is not willing to promote.
What happened today is a drama of democracy. But it should not be forgotten that the main drama is hunger, poverty, inflation and the fraudulent indebtedness with the IMF that unfortunately this government legalized and validated with the IMF last March. And since then that imperial entity co-governs the Argentina of the adjustment.
The people in the streets must mobilize for both issues: to stop the political persecution and the attacks against Cristina. And so that the adjustment of the government, carried out by Massa, the IMF and the monopolies, ends.

\*\*\*

The key to understanding the essence of armed conflicts is to fix in consciousness the moment when the peaceful development of capitalism passes into the phase of the clash of armies and fleets, that is, the main institutions of state violence. Outwardly, it seems that there is a fundamental difference between the era of peaceful life and the period of warfare, that these are two completely opposite states of society. Bourgeois ideology and bourgeois theory of wars are filled with hypocritical pacifism and focus all attention on the moment of the outbreak of hostilities, on the validity, political expediency or inexpediency of the external side of the conflict. The conflicts between states themselves are considered as a product of the will of individual politicians, the clash of some abstract ""national interests"".

<...>

War serves as a natural means of eliminating the discrepancy between the growth of productive forces, primarily in the idiotic form of capital accumulation, on the one hand, and the division of spheres of influence for financial capital, on the other. Take, for example, this Leninist truth:

""The epoch of modern capitalism shows us that certain relations are developing between unions of capitalists on the basis of the economic division of the world, and next to this, in connection with this, certain relations are developing between political unions and states on the basis of the territorial division of the world, the struggle for colonies, the struggle for economic territory.""

So, between the capitalists of the West, first of all the USA, England, France, Germany, well-known relations have developed on the basis of a complete economic division of the world, which look like the hegemony and dictatorship of Western multinational corporations from military-industrial conglomerates and oil and gas corporations to IT giants and big pharma. And next to this, in connection with this, an alliance of states has formed, including in the form of the NATO alliance, which suppresses the sovereignty of individual countries and resorts to force of arms where necessary, or provokes wars with the hands of crazed nationalists.

As soon as the Soviet state was destroyed and the dictatorship of capital prevailed, all conditions were created for entrepreneurs, firstly, to tear the country to pieces, and secondly, to fall into universal competition, that is, a war of all against all, creating many configurations both among themselves and with their Western ""partners"", thus setting fire to all new ""hot spots"" on the territory of the USSR. The mass death of people and the rampant fascism is the payment for the bungling shown by the people in 1991.

\*\*\*

**From a general theoretical approach to the specifics of a particular**

On February 24, 2022, the bourgeois Russian Federation, represented by President Putin, announced a special military operation in Ukraine, referring to the policy of NATO expansion and a number of other circumstances that gave rise to the outbreak of hostilities. In essence, we are talking about the fact that one bourgeois state openly intervenes in a civil war in another bourgeois state on the side of the rebellious people of Donbass and the bourgeois ""people's republics"" that subsequently emerged.

Let us recall some conclusions about the situation in Ukraine that we made in 2019. So, we argued:

1. After 2014, a pro-Western group of oligarchs seized power in Ukraine, finally turning the Ukrainian state into a puppet, primarily of the American oligarchy. Ukraine, like Poland and the Baltic states before, has become an outpost of American imperialism in Eastern Europe.

2. The power in the Russian Federation is in the hands of the oligarchy, that is, financial capital, and is guided solely by the interests of preserving state-monopolistic capitalism in Russia and expanding its domination outside. All the talk about protecting the ""Russian world"" and the multipolar world concept is a cover.

3. The civil war in Ukraine was unleashed by the Western oligarchy:

""The Maidan, the annexation of Crimea to the Russian Federation, the formation of the LDPR and the civil war, with all the complex and contradictory course of these processes, are primarily the product of the policy of American and European oligarchs. In this case, the Russian bourgeoisie acted according to the situation, trying not to weaken its position in the conditions of the loss of influence in Kiev.""

4. The participation of the bourgeois Russian Federation in the civil war in Ukraine through the so-called Minsk and Normandy formats, that is, in fact, the preservation of the conflict, was dictated by political motives of countering American imperialism. The bourgeois Russian Federation, feeling its weakness, did not openly interfere in the civil war in Ukraine, but also did not allow the Armed Forces of Ukraine to seize Donbass. Such participation of the Russian Federation was not imperialistic in nature, it was not aimed at seizing territories or remaking spheres of influence. However, at the same time, we noted that, quite possibly, the Russian oligarchy was hatching expansionist plans for Ukraine.

5. We have pointed out that the principled position of Marxism in any such conflict is that the proletariat must turn its weapons against any bourgeoisie: Ukrainian, Russian, American, European, Donetsk, Lugansk. But since such a slogan would be an empty concussion of the air in the current situation, since there are no appropriate conditions for its nomination, the most productive solution to the situation would be the defeat of the Ukrainian government in the civil war.

6. We predicted the three most likely scenarios that could lead to the end of the civil war: 1) if a communist revolution takes place in Russia, Ukraine or Donbass and the dictatorship of the working class resolves the issue peacefully or militarily; 2) if power in Ukraine passes into the hands of a pro-Russian oligarchy; 3) if the Russian oligarchs have a need to resolve the issue militarily.

At the same time, since 2019, there has been a significant change in the international situation. The confrontation between world imperialism and China has sharply escalated, the American oligarchy has essentially unleashed a new cold war against the PRC, in which the bourgeois Russian Federation is a springboard on the way to encircling and isolating China. The pressure of American and European imperialism on the bourgeois Russian Federation has significantly intensified in all directions, including through internal attacks on Belarus and attempts to provoke an ""orange revolution"" in Russia (poisoning of Navalny and activation of the liberal opposition). There have been many publications about this, in which we have developed the idea that the world system of imperialism is on the verge of a new world war. 

The behavior of the bourgeois Russian Federation in a changing environment was consistently mercantile and ""business"". At first, she was put forward proposals to Western imperialism led by the United States to voluntarily leave Eastern Europe, primarily Ukraine, that is, to recognize the sphere of influence of Russian financial capital, which would guarantee the neutrality of the Russian Federation in the confrontation between the United States and China. And after ignoring these proposals, the Russian Federation initiated a special operation in Ukraine. 

There has clearly been a change in the strength of the potentials of the Russian and Western oligarchies, since for the first time the conversation went on equal terms. And also the fact that the degree of pressure from the United States turned out to be critical for the Russian oligarchy. The military-political leadership of the Russian Federation, expressing the interests and needs of the Russian oligarchy, considered that further passive procrastination only worsens the situation of the country, and a ""fight"" is still inevitable. It cannot be ruled out that the Ukrainian Armed Forces were really preparing a massive offensive on Donbass and even on Crimea.

The outbreak of hostilities in Ukraine completed the period of preparation for the open struggle of American imperialism for the preservation of its hegemony and the world order that developed after the collapse of the USSR. There was a sharp mobilization of Western countries, they all as one began to pump up the Ukrainian army with weapons, supply intelligence and recruit mercenaries. In the domestic politics of Western countries, there is exactly the same rejection of bourgeois-democratic freedoms that was observed in the 1950s in the so-called era of McCarthyism.

In turn, the actions of the United States as an imperialist state are dictated by the tasks of preserving the hegemony of American corporations and the business interests of all major entities belonging to the structurally Anglo-Saxon system of the globalized economy, which stretched tentacles around the globe after the collapse of the USSR. They can conditionally distinguish two sides — political and economic.

The political side is the unleashing of a new cold war against China, in which the Russian Federation has an important springboard on the approaches to the PRC. In it, economic benefits appear indirectly through competition with the Chinese state capital, and, of course, there is a moment of fear of communism and the socialist state as such. The dynamics of the development of modern China clearly shows the high efficiency of the communist government even in a market economy.

The economic side of the actions of American imperialism is associated with direct benefits from specific decisions, for example, in the form of enriching the private military-industrial complex from arms supplies and the arms race in general, oil and gas giants from the redistribution of the European gas market, the ruin of the masses of small owners, etc.

The same thing exists in the position of the imperialists of France and Germany, with the only difference that it reflects the balancing and relations of the monopolists of these countries with their American ""colleagues"", that is, in this case they directly and openly support the United States in the confrontation with the Russian Federation, but are somewhat reeling, not wanting a direct confrontation with China. The inter-imperialist contradictions between the US and the EU are also growing, as the US oligarchs directly use Europe to their advantage, regardless of the economic and social damage to the power of their ""partners"".

\*\*\*

**The complexity of the conflict showed the theoretical helplessness of the left**

The beginning of the special operation of the Russian Federation in Ukraine was an event in which leftist figures and organizations differed. But the special operation did not just cause a split of the left into supporters and opponents of the war, but transferred the entire theoretical assessment of the situation to the plane of purely external phenomena. Putin and Russian imperialism get it from some leftists, Zelensky, Biden and American imperialism get it from other leftists. A lot of speculation revolves around Ukrainian fascist gangs and the role of NATO countries in the conflict. **However, almost no one reveals the role of capitalism itself in the war.**

None of the leftists dared to reason from the general to the particular. So, all entrepreneurs are competitors, and they are much more internationalists than proletarians. They do not need to be called to internationalism, they themselves are always looking for combinations on the side. No wonder some Russian oligarchs kept money abroad, they are always for any war, but on the side of a potential winner, as it seems to them. Another question is that the Russian Federation is full of entrepreneurs who have nothing to look for behind the ""hill"", but they never pay attention to race, nationality, or religious affiliation. Periodically, political leaders come on the scene expressing the aspirations of some groups of capitalists, not only large, but also small, sometimes comprador, sometimes nationalist, but this does not change much in the overall picture. So all wars in general are conducted exclusively by the bourgeoisie, regardless of which nation they belong to, in which country they live and in which combination they entered the war. But the scapegoat is always the state and the army.

Therefore, whatever the specifics, no matter how significant the nuances of a particular military campaign may seem, while the masses of ordinary people are under the impression of political chatter, the militaristic component, state policy, the role of presidents and field commanders, immersed in an attempt to embrace all these nuances in the process of searching for personal culprits, nothing threatens capitalism itself. The topic of capitalism in war is viewed by the modern left so sluggishly and faintly that the mass of citizens do not have claims, hatred and contempt for capitalism as the source of all wars. The fact that today there are borders, countries, governments, political systems and figures — all this is secondary, inherited by the earthly community as remnants of slavery, feudalism, clerical fragmentation. That's the main thing.

""The People (by and large) have been conditioned to compete, not cooperate; to revere hyper-individualism while looking skeptically upon collective work and responsibility; to be dependent on the same institutions responsible for their oppression instead of depending on one another.

But what if we could provide them with the blueprint to expose the fallacy of this socially engineered lie? What if we could develop a framework where we could demonstrate through social practice that Unity will serve Our interests more effectively than division, that a new and more prosperous way of social life could – be had RIGHT NOW, if only we withdrew from the fascist arrange ment by building Our own Autonomous Infrastructure.

If we make a dialectical materialist analysis of the primary “productiveness point” in the U.S. fascist arrangement we find it is the workers, the People themselves, who are that “productive point.” We can not hope to convince the People to abandon the chains they have become comfortable with, without also providing them with a liberation that still meets their basic needs.

5049,wl4v5w,Report on Canada Day 2022 Toronto,"(I am crossposting this from Canada Left)

On the 155th anniversary of the Confederation of this fair country, the Sisters in Solidarity Indigenous group and other grassroots organizers chose to disrupt this nationalist holiday and denounce the Canadian government’s long and bloody history of colonial and capitalist conquest and violence against the Native peoples of this land. Since the bourgeois press has, as usual, chosen to ignore this important demonstration, I am publishing a short report on the protest.

The demonstration began at Yonge and Dundas Square in downtown Toronto. Nearby, a pro-imperialist Hong Kong “democracy” demonstration passed to the west along Dundas, bearing Canadian flags, Union Jacks, and other symbols of global imperialism. They left the area, and we did not see them again.

Our march took over the square, disrupting traffic and transit and calling out the genocidal history of Canada. Seasoned marshals took to street corners to form blockades while Indigenous speakers spoke and gave stirring speeches from a flatbed truck, talking about everything from the brutality of the residential schools and the raw realities of sex trafficking to rapping and cracking jokes to lighten the mood. We chanted “No Justice No peace” and “No Pride in Genocide” and marched, a multi-ethnic crowd, with many of us in orange shirts.

We marched south, blocking off traffic at intervals for more speeches, provoking the anger of several reactionaries. Near Union Station, at the Esplanade and Yonge, on the way to the lake, several autonomous demonstrators blocked off a tunnel, while the main body of demonstrators marched on towards the lakeshore. A white man threatened a marshal, asserting that he would shove a skateboard up his behind. An older white couple exited their car, with the white man yelling to “get the F out of the way.” Still, marshals and our legal observer, as well as several other protestors, stood firm, even as we received anger and threats from several white individuals, with one gasping in exasperation: Why are you protesting on Canada Day? A few drivers began to act ominously with their vehicles.

We marched down to the lake and took the intersection at Yonge and Queen’s Quay. Marshalls took the corners and more speeches were had. We had a testy moment when a bearded white man began to become aggressive with us. He was acting ominously with his car, yelling and cursing. He eventually made a racist remark against Native peoples, asserting (I paraphrase) that “You assholes should be happy that we are here to take care of you.” In time, we de-escalated the situation and he backed off.

We ended the demonstration at Bay and Queens Quay. Tourists were everywhere, hanging around in the sun. We took the intersections, more speeches were had, and marshals again de-escalated angry passengers, including one grumpy old white man blasting the Eagles. Once, at a Black Live Matter demonstration, we marched up Keele Street through a heavily racialized and working class section of Toronto, and got plenty of support, honks, and cheers (and only one racist I saw) from the Toronto poor and proletariat, a class used to abuse and poverty from the government and police. This current demonstration was in an extremely affluent area, right by the lake, and we saw plenty racist anger and minimal support from the surrounding crowds, although several Persians came out to support the blockade.

After a while, marshals and demonstrators carefully, with hands linked, backed off the road and let traffic through. Throughout the demonstration, police presence / intervention was minimal. We ended the demonstration against the imperialist Canada Day holiday in good spirits.",6264023772277242806,0

5051,wkhb4k,The Shock of Recognition by J. Sakai is the single most interesting text that I have read in a long time,"Recently, the rise of fascism is a subject which has sparked my interest, and I was recommended *The Shock of Recognition* by J. Sakai as a worthwhile read (a special thank you to /u/GenosseMarx3 for that).

*The Shock of Recognition*, which was released two decades ago now, is itself an excerpt from a larger work titled *Confronting Fascism: Discussion Documents for a Militant Movement*. The first section of that work, which was written by Don Hamerquist, is frequently referenced by Sakai throughout the text since his own addition was in part a response to Hamerquist the way I understand it.

So let me get to the content itself. Sakai begins the text in an interesting way by discussing the misconception that fascism can only come about in white societies. Having written the text in the aftermath of 9/11, Sakai says that:

>We weren’t thinking about fascism while we watched two 757s full of people fly into the ex-World trade Center. And maybe we still weren’t thinking of fascism when we heard about the first-ever successful attack on the Pentagon. But fascism was thinking about us.

Sakai then launches into a discussion of what he calls ""pan-Islamic fascism"". Sakai analyzes the class background of various groups which we in the West loosely place under the label of ""Islamic fundamentalism"", although he argues that these groups don't actually have much at all to do with the holy scriptures of the religion which they claim to adhere to. I quote Sakai:

>But what the West calls “islamic fundamentalism” is not that at all. First off, like its brother “christian fundamentalism” there’s some kind of relationship to religion but there’s nothing *fundamental* about it. There’s no similar vibe between white racist abortion clinic bombers today and some outcast Jewish carpenter with illegal anti-ruling class ideas in the Middle East 2000 years ago. And the Prophet Mohammad’s youngest wife wasn’t wearing a burka and hiding indoors, she was riding the desert alongside male warriors and disputing doctrine with male preachers as the head of her own religious school.  
>  
>...  
>  
>The modern islamic rightists, who began in 1927-28 with the founding of Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood, took religious ideological form but were started as a *political* movement against British neo-colonial domination. They were backed not by workers or peasants but by the middle-class bazaar merchants and traders. The core of the islamic rightists from the beginning were not theologians but young men who had middle-class educations as scientists and technicians (like today’s Mohammad Atta who supposedly led the 911 attacks), and who used assassinations and trade boycotts. One trend within this broader islamist political movement developed fascist politics and a definite fascist class agenda. The fact that everything is explained in religious ideological terms doesn’t change the fact that their program and class strategy fit fascism perfectly. Perhaps that’s the real “fundamentalism” that they have.  
>  
>...  
>  
>Throughout the Muslim world, from Saudi Arabia to Egypt to Turkey to Pakistan, Western imperialism has helped maintain militarized neo-colonial regimes that have looted and deadended society. They have destroyed local subsistance economies of self-production for use in favor of globalized export-import economies. The number of the declassed, those without any regular relationship to economic production and distribution, keeps growing. The lower-middle classes keep losing their small plots of land, their small market businesses, their toehold in the educated professions. These are men who are threatened with the loss of everything that defined them, including the ability of patriarchs to own households of women and children.  
>  
>This is the class basis of today’s pan-islamic fascism, which demands a complete reversal of fortune. Revolutions where today’s Muslim elites shall be in the prisons or the gutter and the warriors of fascism shall be the new class ruling over the palaces, mosques and markets.

Moving on to the crux of the text, Sakai makes the argument that the old left's view of fascism and its origins is inaccurate, and that a failure to grasp the roots of fascism presents a real danger. Fascism, according to Sakai, ""*isn’t born because some big bankers and industrialists give secret orders from a smoke-filled room*"".

>*...the left has no real analysis of fascism. Either it’s just a label we attach to anything bad or it’s only the repressive policy, the punishing puppet that the real villain, the capitalist ruling class, wields to hold onto power. Notice that in neither case does fascism exist as a real social development in its own right.*  
>  
>...  
>  
>*...our present left theories and responses to fascism are actually the same theories and strategies that the European left used with such spectacular lack of success against fascism in the 1920s-30s.*

Watering down the term ""fascism"" to mean anything we don't like has historically constituted a gift to the real fascists, and Sakai asks whether or not we are still stuck on the same path today. Again, I quote:

>*One important reason that the German working class couldn’t focus on Nazism is that the left had effectively watered-down the meaning of fascism, in effect convincing many to ignore the decisive fascist events as just more political musical chairs. Is the same thing happening here, right now?*

Sakai enters into a discussion about the fact that capitalism as an economic mode of production can manifest itself politically through a liberal democracy (Germany), military junta (Pinochet-era Chile), or a religious theocracy (Saudi Arabia). It is true that fascism wants to keep capitalism as an economic model and that this ultimately benefits the bourgeoisie in a way, but this does not mean that fascism constitutes a bourgeois ideology. Instead Sakai argues that fascism will actually carry with it a certain anti-capitalist/anti-imperialist flair.

A quote from Hamerquist that Sakai cites:

>*The emerging fascist movement for which we must prepare will be rooted in popular nationalist anti-capitalism and will have an intransigent hostility to various state and supra-state institutions.*

Sakai:

>*Fascism is a revolutionary movement of the right against both the bourgeoisie and the left, of middle class and declassed men, that arises in zones of protracted crisis. Fascism grows out of the masses of men from classes that are abandoned on the sidelines of history. By transforming men from these classes and criminal elements into a distorted type of radical force, fascism changes the balance of power. It intervenes to try and seize capitalist State power – not to save the old bourgeois order or even the generals, but to gut and violently reorganize society for itself asnew parasitic State classes.*...*The truth here is startling and it isn’t in the least bit vague. The new fascism is, in effect, “anti-imperialist” right now.* *It is opposed to the big imperialist bourgeoisie (unlike Mussolini and Hitler earlier, who wanted even stronger, bigger Western imperialism), to the transnational corporations and banks, and their world-spanning “multicultural” bourgeois culture. Fascism really wants to bring down the World Bank, WTO and NATO, and even America the Superpower. As in destroy. That is, it is anti-bourgeois but not anti-capitalist. Because it is based on fundamentally pro-capitalist classes.Fascism, in this slowly accelerating global crisis of transformation, believes in what we might call basic capitalism, o.g. capitalism. It is the would-be champion of local male classes vs. the new transnational classes. Enemy of emigrant Third World labor and the modern supra-imperialist State alike, fascism draws on the weakening national classes of the lower-middle strata, local capitalists and the layers of declassed men.*

I think this is quite an enlightening analysis that resonates with previous observations I've made. Sakai does seem to explain far more than the old left's somewhat simplistic theories. ""*The masses of men from classes that are abandoned on the sidelines of history*"" that Sakai talks about sounds just like the Silent Majority in the US. The Brexit sympathizers (the reactionary ones) are another example. There are further examples all over Europe, really.

However - and I think this is crucially important - Sakai raises a definite red flag against the simplistic interpretation that working class poverty leads to fascism, and that the rise of fascism specifically has to do with ""the crisis of white settlerism"":

>*Fascism hasn’t come from working class poverty or oppression. That’s a deliberate capitalist intellectual confusion we have to get rid of. The oppression that colonial workers had to endure in Asia, Afrika, Latin America and the Mideast didn’t produce fascism but hopeful, radical left movements of liberation that might have been ultimately subverted, but that also contained the constructive efforts of hundreds of millions of ordinary working people. Centuries of lynchings and police state terror and colonial poverty here in the Black Nation never produced anything like fascism, until neo-colonialism and what Malcolm X called “dollarism” took over.*  
>  
>*So don’t be thinking that fascism just comes from poverty or recession, because it’s not that way at all. In Euro-America – by far the weathiest nation that’s ever existed since Babylon in biblical times – the growth of white fascism has nothing to do with poverty but everything to do with the crisis of white settlerism.*  
>  
>*Settler America has never been really lower working class, remember. The mass of privileged white workers have always been in the labor aristocracy, a layer in the lower middle classes (the millions of immigrant blue-collar workers from Eastern and Southern Europe in the early 20th century were not classed as “white” by Americans back then, but were said to be from inferior “swarthy” races).*

This should be linked to the outsourcing of jobs that took place in the US (and other countries within the imperial center) in connection with the neoliberal wave when many white jobs were transferred from the Western world to the periphery because monopoly capitalism could extract greater profits in these parts of the world. A country like China, which initially played an important and subservient role to US-European imperialism, can now amass more influence which is slowly causing the tides to turn. This shift in balance can be seen as the cause of these white settler aristocrats now constituting a fascist base in American society. Sure, there may be contempt for the bourgeoisie (usually termed the ""globalist elites"" in a typical conspiratorial way which echoes the tunes of anti-semitism) but the hatred is mainly directed at minority groups and in particular immigrants who ""steal our jobs"". I sat down and thought about it and I think an interesting connection could also be made to young white males in the US who write fascist manifestos and then carry out terror attacks. The examples are too numerous.

The ""American way of life"", as they so famously call it, indeed has a real meaning and it is directly tied to the privileged status of settler life.

Sakai continues to discuss an array of other things but I will stop here.

I am interested in learning about the proposal for combating terrorism that we as communists should put forth. I ask today because the killing of Ayman al-Zawahiri seems to have emboldened the crowd who believe that the American war on terror, in any form, is the path to combating terrorism in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Clearly, this belief is misguided, and so I ask: what is is the communist answer to the question of terrorism? My own beliefs are at this point too general for my liking (to address the material conditions which give rise to terrorism, to oppose american imperialism in the region which has directly aided terrorist groups such as the Mujahideen and has sparked a hatred of the American empire in the region which has, to no surprise, caused a turn to terrorism as a reactionary means of expressing this anti-american sentiment, and to engage in political education with the masses) and so I'm interested if anyone has further ideas or resources on the matter of combatting terrorism.",-1277229556525426716,0

5120,w50nzi,A Discussion on Trait of Production and Production Relations,"Edit: Gratitude to all the comrades criticize and discuss in the comment. I know there may be many obstacles and mistakes when you get to know a -ism. So, now I hope my post can also be a alert or something in your way of learning. 

Hi comrades, I’d like to share my discussion with one of my friends who know much about Marxism. It’s about why the practice of socialism finally collapsed in the last century, and when the conditions for establishing socialism will be formed. I think the arguments are quite novel and thought-provoking, no matter you think it’s reasonable or not. As I did not learn the related theory in English, there might be some mistakes in terms. Hope it intrigue you. Free to discuss and criticize.

It started with a paper I read when I was working on my term paper. As it’s published on a Chinese journal, I’ll summarize it in English, and post its DOI number.

Article / 马克思主义劳资关系理论与当代社会

Author / 周新军

Source / 《经济评论》No.5, 2001

DOI:  10.19361/j.er.2001.05.006

The paper discussed labor relations, and here are the author’s opinions:

1. In Marx’s theory, the privatization of means of production causes laborers to be separated from the means of production, thus leading to labor alienation. But it’s determined by the trait of modern production system. It can be explained by a economic term ‘scarcity’. In industrial economy, capital is a scarce resource while labor is a surplus resource, determining the subordinate status of laborers to capital.
2. Socialist practices mainly focused on eliminating private ownership of means of production, but they did not improve the ways of production. So, ‘real public ownership is built on the basis of alienation’, and didn’t solve the problem of ‘realization form of property rights and the principal-agent relationship’. Due to bureaucracy, although laborers were in the production and even management, they didn’t have the power to determine the production goal. The system neglected laborers’ subjective initiative, so the contradictions of capitalism were not wiped out.
3. Exploitation is shown in the process of allocation. In capitalism, bourgeoisie appropriates the surplus value for free. A more efficient allocation system is needed in the public ownership system, to ensure the realization.
4. The contradiction between labor and capital is the fundamental contradiction of capitalism. According to dialectical materialism, there are 3 ways to solve contradiction:(1) One side of the contradiction overcomes the other. (2) Both sides of the contradiction die together and give birth to new contradictions. (3) Sides of the contradiction reconcile. In modern capitalist world, ‘Capital has increasingly abandoned the attributes of private capital, and increasingly has the attributes of social capital’. So, future ways to socialism are based on the second and third points.

And based on this, I gave my extended opinion: It’s a historical stage that laborers are subordinate to capital due to scarcity. However, it doesn’t mean that socialist movements are unnecessary. According to this logic, labor movement is a way to gain laborers more scarcity.

My question is: then, does it mean that we should wait until ways of production become subordinate to laborers? Like advanced technology taking over all the factories, people are free to do jobs that are in accordance with human nature.

That’s my friend’s reply:

The theory is like productivity theory, and has its limits. Capitalism is not mass production or industrial production or something else, it is a production relation. Phenomenology (I think it’s mysterious and cool) tells that means of production plus this production relation, equals capital. No matter how advanced a technology is, once it’s still under the capitalist production relation, capitalism will exist.

So, although it might be partly determined by the trait of modern industry, we should work on changing this relation. This includes designing a system, where laborers are included in the real decision stage. In fact, that’s what Mao tried to do in the Cultural Revolution. There ARE obvious flaws in the former practice, but they don’t necessarily mean that we should passively wait until the main ways of production become subordinate to laborers, to humans.

I’m partly persuaded, and I think his words are reasonable, too. I say I'm partly persuaded: is because I'm  in favor of technology determinism. Reforming the production relation is one part of constructing socialism, but the trait of production system is the decisive factor.

Later we went on to discuss about other things, so that’s all. Thanks for reading 😊",-8563733283715905725,0

And to be frank, many soviet films were far more creative than western ones. I particularly love their sci-fi movies (""On the Silver Globe"" and ""Solaris"" in particular)

But I will admit that Soviet Censorship was a problem. Yuri Norstein (One of the greatest animators of all time) was constantly battling soviet censorship to get his surreal films to the public, and ""The Commisar"" was literally banned for not showing the soviet union in a positive enough manner(even though it clearly advocated that the revolution gave women rights, one of the main themes of the film)

Another aspect I find interesting is the production companies; which are some of the oldest in the world. Each country had it's own state-backed film production company, and when the USSR fell, these companies still remained and some (such as Georgiafilm and Belarus film) remain the biggest producers in their respective countries.",-8802710738867246172,0

5197,vnsqv2,Cultural stagnation under late capitalism,"""The past is another planet"", said Neil deGrasse Tyson.  Well, maybe it used to be, but appears to be no longer.  Some commentators have highlighted how the dramatic changes in western style and culture we have seen up until the 90s appear to have slowed down and stagnated.  For instance:

https://www.highbrowmagazine.com/2303-dead-culture-how-our-culture-became-stagnant

https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2012/01/prisoners-of-style-201201/amp

It used to be possible to immediately work out which decade a western style belonged to right up to the 90s.  But it's more difficult to distinguish between styles in the 2020s, the 2010s, even the late 1990s (despite the obvious rapid development of technology: smart phones, computers, etc).

My point here is not to debate the merits of this observation, but to explore possible explanations why this might be the case.  Assuming that this is a real phenomenon, are there any works that analyse this from a Marxist perspective?  Any recommendations?
 
Since culture is superstructure built on material conditions, it can't be coincidence that this supposed stagnation commenced around the time of the end of the Cold War, 1991. The  bourgeois ideologue Francis Fukuyama at the time spoke of ""The End of History"" - it seems to me that despite history obviously not having ended, bourgeois society does indeed have an interest in pretending it has.

Of particular interest would be housing, work, whatever kind of wage-based systems have been implemented.

We know of the need for a planned economy but I'm interested in how this has been tried - where is had successes and where it failed. Yugoslavia, for example, is of interest given that it had a ""mixed economy"" and a good channel on YouTube (Balkans Odyssey) discusses how the marketised elements of the economy are what eventually led to its downfall, and of course Gorbachev's reforms are understood in a similar fashion.

But I'd really like to know more about how these economies were arranged.",8795340433800,0

Today it has all came to me finally. 20 years of moving will show you the disgusting side of capitalism. Without going on all day about my point I have decided to keep it simple. We have moved very rich, sometimes celebrities and influential people all throughout Texas.

These people have everything you can imagine. Multiple houses, beach houses, lake houses, art costing of $100,000, pets worth more than my car, top of the line vehicles, electronics, children are in expensive private schools, best clothes you could imagine, cosmetics, food and alcohol, and probably even the pen they write the check with. I have seen it all.

Usually their move consists of multiple trips, workers and trucks, packing and materials, sometimes long distance, assembly, and sometimes multiple days. These people will literally tell us they wouldn't even get out of bed for what we make. Now when it comes time to pay they almost always complain. They even have the nerve to complain over $3000. 

They won't get out of bed for what we make but expect us to? We are not worth that price but they are worth the $500,000 and up a year to sit at a desk? They never argue about spending $100k on a painting or buying a mansion with a new Porsche. It is easy and they say it is worth it. But $3000 of multiple days of back breaking labor, materials, and driving is too expensive.

These are the same people who say communist control wealth and make everyone else a slave. These people are everything that they fear and say communism is. They want to be on top while everyone else stays a working peasant. They want to make all the money but do not want to pay anyone else. I see where the disgust for capitalism comes from. These people use the system to only get richer while everyone gets no where.

I am sorry everyone I just had to vent. I work part time for a lawyer who has always favored communism. I start to see his point more and more everyday. I don't know much but already it sounds good to my ears.",6538073037133828580,0

I figured someone here could either give me advice on how to go about this, or tell me why it's not a good idea.

I am fairly new to Marxism, and I have no idea if this would even be plausible but maybe it could do something. I have absolutely no idea how to go about organizing this kind of thing though, and the thought of it is horrifying to me as that is a lot of pressure and not something I would normally do. 

That being said it's obvious that something needs to be done about this, and ""voting them out"" is obviously not working. If our main ace up the sleeve as the working class is to not provide our labor then this would be a good time to organize as many people as possible to leave work on one of the most ""patriotic"" days of the year. Not to mention the Miranda Rights bill that was changed too. 

Is this a good idea, or should I just cast this out of my head? Or is there something like this already? If it does exist already, what is it called and how can I support it?

5244,vgvhed,Some questions about Lenin's State and Revolution,"Ayo theory-heads I finished State and Revolution by Lenin some days ago and I found it incredible – but I also have some questions on three topics which I hope yall can help me on:

 **the self-acting armed organization of the population** 

The first and probably most relevant one is around the idea of the “self-acting armed organization of the population”. Lenin says that it wouldn’t work in today’s society because of its antagonistic classes, but he also says that this idea is to be implemented straight after revolution, which makes it very questionable and (seemingly) dangerous. Regarding this, I have a couple of concrete questions:   

1. Are there any other solutions proposed by leftists to replace the functions that would, in Lenin’s theory, be done by the armed population (besides keeping the police/military part of the state, I don’t really like that either).  
2. Was this idea actually implemented anywhere? (this may seem like an “ah communism sucks because north Korea etc” type of take but that’s not the case, I’m just curious). Are there any studies on it?

**The “abolition of parliamentarism” chapter** 

This is not really a question but I got hella confused when reading the whole “Abolition of parliamentarism” chapter. Besides not really understanding what Marx and Lenin meant with “working bodies” (when Lenin wrote “The way out of parliamentarism is not, of course, the abolition of representative institutions and the elective principle, but the conversion of the representative institutions from talking shops into “working” bodies.”, per example) 

I did not understand what are the issues with the current system, besides bureaucracy, and how the proposed solution would work/solve those problems. This is probably my fault and in no way a criticism of Lenin by myself, but all that understood from the whole chapter was: “The way they do it is bad because it its necessarily bureaucratic. Our way to do it is not bureaucratic, therefore, it’s good”. 

I also do not understand the problem with having the legislative and executive powers separated. I haven't really ever think about it deeply but it just seems reasonable to have them in different hands.

 **The disappearing of the need for violence under communism** 

“\[under communism\] the need for violence against people in general, for the subordination of one man to another, and of one section of the population to another, will vanish altogether since people will become accustomed to observing the elementary conditions of social life without violence and without subordination.” – this seems like the base idea of communism, and I really like it. But I need to read more about it, as, besides the argument about the way it worked in primitive society, there’s not much (in this book) that makes it clear that society would develop this way under socialism/communism. Here I would specifically ask for book/article recommendations, as it seems like a complex topic.

**Conclusion**

I read this book because I was looking for explanations on how communism would actually work. It was great and, besides book/article recs to answer the questions above, I would also ask for books that develop this idea of how a communist society would work. I’m sorry for probably being too long and thankful in advance for the attention and (hopefully) the answers.",-2158675311040653363,0

5282,vavex8,Opportunism and its Social Causes,"# Opportunism and its Social Causes

&#x200B;

>^(‘Opportunism is a theory and practice within the labour movement which contradicts the holistic interests of the proletariat and pushes it on a path beneficial to the bourgeoisie.’)`[1]`

This is the point of departure we have for this article. We have used the term, *holistic* interests of the proletariat and such a concept must have a concrete and definite definition. This  holistic interests of the proletariat cannot refer to the interests of an individual proletarian or a quantity within the proletariat — national, specific, etc. — it must refer to the *holistic abstraction* `[2]` *of the historical interests* — that is, the conditions of emancipation — of this specific position in the relations of production. This is what is meant by the *holistic interests of the proletariat*. This refers to: 1) The historical interests of the proletariat; 2) The historical mission of the proletariat; 3) The conditions of the emancipation of the proletariat. The completion of this mission means: “the *positive* transcendence of *private property* as *human self-estrangement*, and therefore as the real *appropriation* of the *human* essence by and for man…the complete return of man to himself as a *social* (i.e., human) being – a return accomplished consciously and embracing the entire wealth of previous development…the *genuine* resolution of the conflict between man and nature and between man and man – the true resolution of the strife between existence and essence, between objectification and self-confirmation, between freedom and necessity, between the individual and the species. Communism is the riddle of history solved, and it knows itself to be this solution.”`[3]`

>^(“When socialist writers ascribe this world-historic role to the proletariat, it is not at all, as Critical Criticism pretends to believe, because they regard the proletarians as gods. Rather the contrary. Since in the fully-formed proletariat the abstraction of all humanity, even of the semblance of humanity, is practically complete; since the conditions of life of the proletariat sum up all the conditions of life of society today in their most inhuman form; since man has lost himself in the proletariat, yet at the same time has not only gained theoretical consciousness of that loss, but through urgent, no longer removable, no longer disguisable, absolutely imperative need — the practical expression of necessity — is driven directly to revolt against this inhumanity, it follows that the proletariat can and must emancipate itself. But it cannot emancipate itself without abolishing the conditions of its own life. It cannot abolish the conditions of its own life without abolishing all the inhuman conditions of life of society today…It is not a question of what this or that proletarian, or even the whole proletariat, at the moment regards as its aim. It is a question of what the proletariat is, and what, in accordance with this being, it will historically be compelled to do. Its aim and historical action is visibly and irrevocably foreshadowed in its own life situation as well as in the whole organization of bourgeois society today.”) `[4]`

The *conditions of emancipation* of the proletariat is the abolition of the conditions of its own life which consequently is the emancipation of humanity{2}. This historical mission is nothing other than the abolition of private property and wage labour which itself will necessitate and bring about the abolition of all classes, and class antagonisms. However, this historical act, *in all cases*, presupposes the conquest of political power by the proletariat:

>^(“It is only in an order of things in which there are no more classes and class antagonisms that social evolutions will cease to be political revolutions. Till then, on the eve of every general reshuffling of society, the last word of social science will always be:)  
>  
>^(«Le combat ou la mort ; la lutte sanguinaire ou le néant. C’est ainsi que la question est invinciblement posée.»”)`[5]`

In this sense, opportunists contradict with this holistic-historical-interest and *mission* in favour of the preservation of the present state of things. Opportunists, through treacherous compromises, either directly with the bourgeoisie or with bourgeois forces, betray the interests of the proletariat in favour of private, individual, etc. interests and motives. However, till here, we’ve only emphasised on the theoretical conception of opportunism as well as some critical conceptions. I must now list the characteristics and forms of opportunism:

1. *Adventurism*, a form of opportunism  which emphasises a set of tactics that are inconsistent, useless or even harmful to serve a political strategy; motivated by personal feelings like “religiosity”, “actionism”, etc. and certainly not by a conscious dedication to a set of principles or to a consistent political strategy;
2. *Liquidationism*, a form of opportunism which demands that; the Vanguard Party ceases its political activity, thus politically disarming the Proletariat in order to “reject”/“protest” Bourgeois politics without neither demonstrating the inconsistency of Bourgeois politics to the masses nor allowing the proletariat a weapon for the conquest of political power which is the only real means to “end” bourgeois politics. If we want a complete definition: Liquidationism is an opportunistic deviation which fails to see the necessity and practicality of the vanguard party;
3. *Revisionism*, a form of opportunism which puts forward an anti-scientific rejection of the fundamental truths prescribed by Scientific Communism and proven by practice.
4. Class Collaborationism or Class Conciliationism, a form opportunism which empathetically rejects class struggle and puts forward unintelligible theories regarding the “bourgeoisie and proletariat collaborating to build socialism and reconciling their class antagonisms.”;
5. *Social-Chauvinism*, a form of opportunism which supports its “own” bourgeois state — in the name of the “defence of the fatherland”, etc. — against “other” bourgeois states in the process of a reactionary war.

I will now attempt to list the causes of opportunism.

1. The law of uneven — and combined — development and monopoly capitalism which may cause: 1) a specific part of the proletariat or *the* proletariat of *a* specific nation to have contradictory *material* interests with the rest of the proletariat or *other* sections of the proletariat, 2) a specific part of the proletariat to have a lower or higher level of class consciousness and political maturity which may result in political divisions, deviations, etc., 3) a specific part of the proletariat to become practically bourgeois since the bourgeoisie of a “civilised”(developed, imperialist) nation can easily use the spoils of its colonies, subjects, etc. to bribe their proletariat`[6]`. Since capitalism develops unevenly, there can be differing, uneven degrees of political consciousness, economic development etc. and thus cause internal-contradictions and internal-inequalities within the proletariat. We assert that the only way to combat such developments or undermine their effects is through a vanguard party.
2. The *sudden* proletarianisation of the “middle classes” — the petty bourgeoisie, peasantry, etc. — which pushes them to the ranks of the proletariat: 1) without diminishing their petty-bourgeois-reactionary biases and ideology, 2) without rectifying their undisciplined, weak and uncertain petty bourgeois character and psychology, 3) which allows them the chance to exploit the proletarian movement in order to regain their privilege.
3. Combined with the two, and other complex relations, the influence of bourgeois ideology to divert the unconscious, unstable, etc. sections of the proletariat from the revolutionary position of the proletariat.

Thus, though opportunism is indeed a product of bourgeois ideology, bourgeois ideology alone does not always  lead to opportunism. However, if we were to make a list, it would, at its most basic form, include:

1. The law of uneven — and combined — development.
2. Imperialism and the labour aristocracy.
3. The *sudden*`[7]` proletarianisation of the “middle classes”.
4. The presence of non-proletarian elements within the labour movement.
5. The dominance of bourgeois ideology in society and its influence within the labour movement.`[8]`

Though the institutionalisation of bourgeois society plays the most critical role when it comes to the production and reproduction of bourgeois ideology, it alone is not enough either, there must be material, real, tangible processes which cause this and these, as we’ve asserted before, can only be circumvented with a vanguard party. Furthermore, the presence of the petty bourgeois elements within the labour movement is plays an “indispensable” role in the production and reproduction of opportunist ideology within the labour and even within the socialist movement, certain petty-bourgeois intellectuals are known for this, I only need one proof of this:

>^(“Thus it is that M. Proudhon flatters himself on having given a criticism of both political economy and communism: he is beneath them both.)  
>  
>^(“Beneath the economists, since, as a philosopher who has at his elbow a magic formula, he thought he could dispense with going into purely economic details; beneath the socialists, because he has neither courage enough nor insight enough to rise, be it even speculatively, above the bourgeois horizon.)  
>  
>^(“He wants to be the synthesis – he is a composite error. He wants to soar as the man of science above the bourgeois and proletarians; he is merely the petty bourgeois, continually tossed back and forth between capital and labour, political economy and communism.”)`[9]`

Opportunist movements and organisations are characterised by practical recklessness, organisational indiscipline, political primitiveness, thoughtless action, the worship of spontaneity, participation in all social movements; tailing behind the movements in most cases, lack of principles, bourgeois pluralism, lack of organisational centralism and discipline and generalised uncertainty. A consistent ideological struggle against, and the rejection of, opportunism, as proven by all revolutions but especially by The Russian Revolution, is a precondition for the victory of a socialist revolution.

`[1]` “Opportunism means sacrificing the fundamental interests of the masses to the temporary interests of an insignificant minority of the workers or, in other words, an alliance between a section of the workers and the bourgeoisie, directed against the mass of the proletariat.”(Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, [*The Collapse of the Second International*](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1915/csi/vii.htm#:~:text=Opportunism%20means%20sacrificing%20the%20fundamental%20interests%20of%20the%20masses%20to%20the%20temporary%20interests%20of%20an%20insignificant%20minority%20of%20the%20workers%20or%2C%20in%20other%20words%2C%20an%20alliance%20between%20a%20section%20of%20the%20workers%20and%20the%20bourgeoisie%2C%20directed%20against%20the%20mass%20of%20the%20proletariat.))

`[2]` *Abstraction* of the position of the proletariat as a class within the relations of production which, through real scrutiny and concrete, historical observation of bourgeois society, allows us to discover, not only, that the abolition of private property, is a precondition for the emancipation of the proletariat but also that the emancipation of the proletariat conditions humanity to be emancipated. For the first time in history, after thousands of years of oppression and exploitation, of slavery of diverse kinds, the emancipation of a class — the proletariat, will emancipate the whole of society of class and class antagonisms, of private propery, alienation, of oppression and exploitation. It is the mission of the Communists to *carry* her historical mission to the proletariat. Till now, that is, till capitalism as a mode of production came to prevalence and till the proletariat *fully* — contrary to her Roman predecessors, who never came to *fully* develop due to their intermediate position — developed as a class in the bundle of history, it wasn’t possible to imagine Communism something other than *a utopia from the future* or *an obeisance towards the past*, today, Communism is an actuality. Once the international proletariat, under the guidance of the Communist Party, grasps this necessity, at first nationally and then internationally, will herself with the **revolutionary** theory of *scientific* communism, and will complete all of her socialist revolutions in all countries, though beginning in single ones, and then, Communism will be realised for once and for all and the riddle of history will be resolved.

`[6]` “You ask me what the English workers think about colonial policy. Well, exactly the same as they think about politics in general: the same as what the bourgeois think. There is no workers' party here, there are only Conservatives and Liberal-Radicals, and the workers gaily share the feast of England's monopoly of the world market and the colonies.”(Friedrich Engels, [*Letter to Karl Kautsky*](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1882/letters/82_09_12.htm#:~:text=You%20ask%20me,of%20various%20kinds.), September 12, 1882) — The question of labour aristocracy was first expressed by Engels in 1858 and Lenin also placed emphasis on this question in Imperialism, The Collapse of the Second International, etc. and it plays a critical role in the question of opportunism. However, the influence of bourgeois ideology upon the most unstable elements of the labour movement is certainly the fundamental question.

`[7]` “A petty bourgeois driven to frenzy by the horrors of capitalism is a social phenomenon which, like anarchism, is characteristic of all capitalist countries. The instability of such revolutionism, its barrenness, and its tendency to turn rapidly into submission, apathy, phantasms, and even a frenzied infatuation with one bourgeois fad or another—all this is common knowledge.”(V. I. Lenin, [*“Left-Wing” Communism: An Infantile Disorder*](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/lwc/ch04.htm#:~:text=A%20petty%20bourgeois,less%20unusual%E2%80%94situation.))

`[8]` “It is an inevitable manifestation, and one rooted in the process of development, that people from what have hitherto been the ruling class also join the militant proletariat and supply it with educative elements…But in this context there are two observations to be made…when people of this kind…join the proletarian movement, the first requirement is that they should not bring with them the least remnant of bourgeois, petty-bourgeois, etc., prejudices, but should unreservedly adopt the proletarian outlook. These gentlemen, however…are chock-full of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas. In a country as petty-bourgeois as Germany, there is certainly some justification for such ideas. But only outside the Social-Democratic Workers’ Party. If the gentlemen constitute themselves a Social-Democratic petty-bourgeois party, they are fully within their rights…But within a workers’ party they are an adulterating element. Should there be any reason to tolerate their presence there for a while, it should be our duty only to tolerate them, to allow them no say in the Party leadership and to remain aware that a break with them is only a matter of time.”(K. Marx, F. Engels, [*Circular Letter to August Bebel, Wilhelm Liebknecht, Wilhelm Bracke and Others*](https://marxists.architexturez.net/archive/marx/works/1879/09/18.htm#:~:text=It%20is%20an,its%20proletarian%20grit.))

5301,v5yqn0,Collaboration with bourgeois parties,"Something I've been  thinking about lately is the relationship between Communism and bourgeois electoralism, specifically situations in which Communist parties are offered an opportunity to participate in a government within the bourgeois-democratic system.  We see today that there are Communist parties in Argentina, South Africa, Chile, Spain, and Sri Lanka, that are parts of what I would describe as bourgeois coalitions.  In this vein, they are described as being part of the government, and presumably they assume that they have an influence on the governance of the nation.  I think that my position on this is that this is not a very good idea.  Lenin did say that me must use every method, legal or illegal, to achieve our goal of Socialism, and I think he's right, but I think doing this is not strategic.  I think there are two ways that Communist parties can engage in bourgeois democracy that are valuable: operating on their own, or in a coalition with other revolutionary parties, and not being elected to government, but influencing the Legislature and gaining publicity; or operating on their own, or in a coalition with other revolutionary parties, and being elected to government.  My rationale for this is that bourgeois parties will always backstab, ignore, or water down revolutionary policy and parties, especially in situations like I listed above, where the parties are very small parties in a junior spot in the coalition.  Look at Chile, Argentina, Spain, and Sri Lanka.  Is the national question anywhere near being solved in these countries?  Are the Catalans and the Basques in Spain better off with Communists ""in government""?  Are the Tamils in Sri Lanka somehow less oppressed with the Communists ""in government""?  I guess what I'm saying is I think it's a really, really bad idea for Communists to work that closely with bourgeois parties.  It will severely dilute the party line of the Communists, and distract them from the goal of revolution; they will start to think they are influencing the government with their 3-seat spot as a junior member of a coalition and forget about real change.  The only times I can think of where Communist parliamentarism has been effective has been where we win, on our own, or with truly revolutionary allies, such as in Nepal, or in Venezuela.  Sorry for the long rant.  Be careful with electoralism.  Let me know if you think I'm wrong (politely)",-4871965178243129016,0

5314,v0foxh,Ezhavas- The force behind rise of Communism in Kerala(An Indian province),"The Ezhavas are a community in the Southwestern Indian state/province of Kerala. Their origin according to myths, is from coconut farmers from Sri Lanka. Later many of them adopted Buddhism and much later, some Hindu beliefs. 
When the upper castes of Brahmins and Nairs formed an unholy alliance over the years and slowly subjugated the native communities, these Ezhavas too got relegated to the position of Outcastes in the Caste System.
They were called as Chandala/ Panchamar as a slur. Many were called as Kotti(A derogatory term for toddy tappers). However not all of them were allowed to continue the job of Toddy making, because many were pushed into slavery. There is a list of Ezhava/Chekon slaves taken from Kochi in kerala by the Dutch East India company in 1783 according to ""Acten Van Transport report Cover ( Dutch )"". The caste has been recorded those who were taken as a slaves in it . The most are from the Pulaya ( Cheramar ) 53 people, under the second place is the caste called Chekon - 49 people, ( 34 men and 15 women ).

Another instance which shows this, is the complaint filed by Kurikkaasseril Madhavan , Kunjiraman and other people from cherthala in 1884 , The complaint says that Ezhavas and other lower castes are prohibited from even near court of the first class district magistrate or even lower court. Even though there are a lot of them(Ezhava) living in the state, there is not even a single one in the government office, they were denied the chance for that. They also had many inconvenience in using public platforms, when they see the upper caste people(called collectively as Savarnas) on the road, etc. When they talk Savarnas, they were supposed to use some ritual words, so that Savarnas don't get defiled..

""The complaint of the Ezhavas that day was, not even a single Ezhavan with 5 rupees salary was in the government service, at least Ezhavas didn't even dare to ask for the freedom of a Dog, to walk on the street"". - Jeevitha Samaram by C.Kesavan, Page No 77.

""THIRUVALLA SAASANAM - even if an Ezhava becomes a Christian, he never becomes an Ezhava, so don't allow cherian ( An Ezhava man who converted into Christianity ) travel near the temple and others who converted to Christianity and force them to go through the fields around to the temple""( Robin Jeffrey - The Decline of the Nair Dominance, Page No. 77 ).

 And they were the victims of untouchablity until 1936. This also meant lack of Job opportunities with a decent pay. So many Ezhava women had to use a loophole in caste system and become night-time prostitutes. Thus they were virtually pushed into prostitution by the oppressors. 

 In 1505 , Duarte Barbosa the famous Europeam historian and travellers those who came to kerala had mentioned in his book, "" Thiyyathi Ladies were the concubine of the Europeans.
Most of the women in Ezhavas have husbands, since they are considered beautiful, especially in port towns they have to be the victims of many temptations, it's rare that they oppose - Thiyyas were the hard labour workers, the wives and daughters of the Thiyyas are doing prostitution, husband endures it humbly without opposing. Apart from them or Muccois/Mukkuvas ( Fishermen caste ), their are no other prostitutes or concubines here. The youngest beauties among them can be given 7 - 8 tharans ( French coins ) The voyage of Francis Pyrad de laval page - 386 , 387 . Caste system in kerala History page # 35

""All the prostitutes in Malabar are from the Thiyya caste. When women of other caste only lay with men of their own caste, the women of Thiyya are ready to sleep with anyone after charging a certain amount. The majority of Thiyyas don't have husbands, that's why they do the prostitution"" ( John Pinkerton - The famous German historian )

"" Ezhava Thiyyas were considered guilty in moral things, but we should understand that the background they came out of ,was like that. A major portion of Christians were from the Thiyya Community... I have seen white children in their houses running and playing, then I could knew they were the children of the soldiers in Kannur Barack... this used to happen as a result of the plantation owners of the east mountains coming to enjoy at the sea bungalows in Kannur ( Poorvvakaala Smaranakal by E.P.Varghese, page- 141 )

The following was a statement from an old Ezhava man who was interviewed by the historian Filippo Osella. 
""In the bad old days our people sold the Toddy they tapped directly from their houses. Nayars would come to the house. They would call for Toddy, and our women would serve it. Some of them would then call for our women to go in the backroom with them, and we let them do it ; what else we could do ? Our houses were Toddy shops and our women were prostituted""
(Social Mobility in Kerala by Filippo Osella)

After many centuries, a gem was born in the Ezhava community. He was called Sri Narayana Guru. He was the main person responsible for uplifting the Ezhava proleteriat, reforming the ill practices in Kerala society and silently kickstarting the Kerala Renaissance. The Keralite Communists took inspiration from his methods and created a syncretric form of Communism which infuses Buddhist Principles, Bhakti Hinduism and the OG Communism straight from Das Kapital. During the Kerala Rennaisance, the Communists helped all the depressed classes including Ezhavas ,by protesting for their rights, educating them, letting them use the things which was earlier restricted to only Upper Castes,etc. The effort of the communists didnt go in vain as the Kerala became the place where the first ever Communist Govt in South Asia was democratically elected. The Ezhavas who formed the largest caste in Kerala voted their benefactors to victory. The victorious communists then introduced Land Reforms in Kerala which took land from the upper castes and distributed it among lower castes. It further made the Ezhavas financially prosperous and independent. It also ensured that most of the Ezhavas and their future descendants will have a loyalty towards the Communist Party. Today the Communists rule the state of Kerala and unsurprisingly most of them are Ezhavas. And as a result, Kerala is the most relatively egalitarian province/state in India today.",1812877608299937269,0
5315,v0d81h,"New takes on materialist philosophy, dialectic materialism and historic materialism"," 

New here on Reddit :)

Researching the topics named above in the title.  
Most of the books are old (ie. "" Dialectical and Historical Materialism"" 1938, Stalin), maybe even Enver Hoxa did some but not sure. I need more recent materials, in order to compare and analyse.

Currently reading ""Contributions to the history of materialism"" by Georgi Valentinovich Plehanov. It does a good job connecting basic human needs with materialist philosophy. However, even if the essence is eternal, the content and form is from those times.

An end result for me would be to (maybe, if there is a need) write a new book about materialist philosophy, since times have changed and a key role nowadays in society is being taken by individualism and idealist philosophy. Combating such philosophy is essential in further societal development. Doing so may make it easier to apply marxist theory in combating capitalism now.

""There is no way to address the cost-of-living crisis or the global  food crisis within the framework of an individual struggle against one  employer or company, no matter how militant. In the fight for affordable  food and basic necessities and a massive increase in wages, the working  class must unite across workplaces, across industries and across  countries to harness its full strength. 

The fight is a political  struggle against the entire capitalist class and the governments they  control. It cannot be won without stopping the imperialist war, which  drains humanity’s technological genius and industrial might, directing  it toward death and destruction when it is desperately needed to save  and improve lives everywhere. This requires socialist revolution, the  expropriation of the wealth of the rich and the placing of the world’s  productive forces under the democratic control of the working class to  abolish hunger and want forever.

In the sites that I've read about they said that he was executed because ""Trotsky was envy of him"", even having a phrase that is supposed said by Schastny confirming it, honesty, this sounds like capitalist speech, trying to ""demonize"" communists but, is that true?

At the same time, the  prosecution and conviction of Vaught  sets a dangerous precedent for the  criminalization of medical errors.  Vaught faces three years of  intrusive probation, has not had her nursing  license restored, and has  suffered enormous personal and emotional  consequences from the unjust  prosecution, while still bearing the weight  of the error itself and the  life that was lost.""",-410342327823516091,0

I would like to ask if anyone goes to a psychologist and what is the assessment from a Marxist point of view of your psychologist's work?

Since there is no Marxist current in psychology, I am afraid that this discipline does not understand, and therefore does not solve, certain doubts and sufferings that lodge in the mind of a Marxist, but rather tries to conform the patient to the model of (capitalist) society in which he/she lives. In short, by doing a kind of ""brainwashing""

**PLEASE NOTE:** If there are psychologists in the sub, my intent is not to belittle your work or label you as a ""shrink,"" I would just like to understand the point of view of a Marxist patient with respect to your work.

I'd recommend reading [Why Socialism](https://speakoutsocialists.org/wp-content/uploads/Einstein-Why-Socialism-web.pdf); an article by Albert Einstein. This article is more on our modern Society answering why we humans accept socialism and how it is inevitable. 

Socialism is the idea and concept of the workers owning the mean of production, distribution, and exchange. It is the most common definition but I’m taking the Marxist definition. The necessary step to communism, and bringing the workers' power to the top. I would be avoiding the definitions from some people being that being [Social Democracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lDZaKjfs4E) is the same as socialism.

Let's first check socialism and capitalism and compare both. The USA is known as the icon of capitalism, and the USSR (1922–1991) is the icon of socialism. Let us check the US literacy rate. 79% is the literacy rate of the US in 2022. The USSR? About 100% by the 1950s. That is success in education. Point 1: socialism

Sources: [Liebowitz, Ronald (1986). Education and Literacy Data in Russian and Soviet Censuses](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctt1g69xfv.13), 

Now, let us check healthcare and healthcare affordability. In the USA, the average ambulance is 1200 USD (not including insurance; when included, it is 450 USD), and 56% of the nation cannot pay for 1000 USD in medical emergencies, let alone an ambulance ride. 265 dollars for just talking to the doctor. The USSR? Healthcare was free, and all Soviet citizens were happy. Point 2: socialism

Sources: [US cost of ambulances](https://www.talktomira.com/post/how-much-does-an-ambulance-ride-cost-without-insurance#:~:text=Bottom%20Line,the%20type%20of%20supplies%20used.), [CNN article about 56% of all US citizens cannot afford a 1000$ emergency](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/19/56percent-of-americans-cant-cover-a-1000-emergency-expense-with-savings.html), [Healthcare of the USSR and its costs](https://books.google.co.in/books?hl=en&lr=&id=cfI6AAAAIAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA3&dq=Leichter,+Howard+M.:+A+Comparative+Approach+to+Policy+Analysis:+Health+Care+Policy+in+Four+Nations&ots=VkCh9FHEe0&sig=25CSSzR-ntfs6LXJxw8oeFP1CEM&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Leichter%2C%20Howard%20M.%3A%20A%20Comparative%20Approach%20to%20Policy%20Analysis%3A%20Health%20Care%20Policy%20in%20Four%20Nations&f=false)

Now our final comparison of socialism and capitalism is the QOL of the nation. Socialist nations, compared to capitalist nations, In socialist nations, the quality of life is better and development is better, according to a study by the authors [S Cereseto](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/S.-Cereseto/13731260), [Howard Waitzkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Waitzkin). 

Source: [Capitalism, socialism, and the physical quality of life](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2430906/)

Now one question is how about the black book of communism? Well, I made an article on that, it talks about [the black book and western democracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/yhage5/a_critique_of_the_black_book_and_western_democracy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Socialism is better in always when comparing Education, Healthcare, and general quality of life. How about freedom? Well, it depends on our definition, is being debt trapped for going to the hospital freedom? Is not being to afford home freedom? To my definition: You have the right to food, shelter, water, cloth, healthcare, and education. That is freedom, Not the right to wave the confederate flag. Well, why is socialism inevitable? Well, to quote Rosa Luxemburg it is either Socialism or Barbarism. We, humans, have the tendency to think it is the end of history. No, it is not. History won't end till a billion or 2 years. Our way of society and material analysis of our world must come to a standard. I’d recommend this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVWwwfcQ5FA) talks about historical materialism.

5510,yo7v77,"Is it worth it to create a Marxist-Leninist party in Central Alberta, (a province in Canada), in a town mostly filled with white people?","For the record, I am a mostly white individual , (Ukrainian-French Canadian-Irish and Egyptian) and I am an autistic person who is seen as a cis woman in my day to day life and who is in my final year of high school. For those of you who aren’t aware, the United Conservative Party, that is in power right now, had changed their leaders from Jason Kenney to a new leader named Danielle Smith, so until the election in Spring, she is the new premier of the province. She wants to separate Alberta from the rest of the country and she is incredibly fiscally conservative and far-right. She hasn’t said anything too controversial about women or other minority groups but I and many other people still don’t trust her. Privatization and the terrible way that the province has been handling Covid is only going to get worse under her. 

The controversy surrounding her got so bad that Rachel Notley from the NDP party had to make an agreement with Smith for Smith to not postpone the election day.  It also doesn’t help that food insecurity is getting worse and the rising cost of living is screwing over Albertans and our healthcare system is continuously getting underfunded. So with all of this in mind, is it worth it to form a Marxist-Leninist party? Not some weak Trotskyist bullshit, I mean a party that operates outside of electoralism and directly helps the people. For me, I’m not so sure.

I stand out from other white people. I have rich, dark brown, 3b curly hair, dark brown eyes and fair skin with neutral/golden undertones. As stated before, I am a quarter Egyptian and my father was a half Egyptian and half Irish man and he is the main source of my ethnic features. Most of the white people around me growing up had straight/slightly wavy hair that ranged from blonde to mousy brown, thin eyebrows and skin that was either tanned or was light and had pink undertones. I had my hair touched by multiple white women throughout my life without any permission. They all had made multiple comments about how beautiful my hair was but then they made passive aggressive remarks about how I should straighten my hair or how I was too hairy. 

I had never straightened my hair successfully nor have I dyed/bleached it, but I had made multiple attempts of shaving my body hair, a few attempts at plucking my eyebrows, one attempt at bleaching the skin on my arms and I even had my hair cut really short just so I can stop people from staring. But no matter what, unless I tied my hair back, I would always get stares from the white devils. My white friends always thought that I was overreacting to the attention and most of my friends of colour have said that I had it easier than them, (which I do, I’m not going to deny that). Since I was raised as Catholic , I kept thinking that I should become a Muslim when I’m older just so I can have my hair covered. But of course, due to the controversies that hijabs have in the western world, I’m not going to do that.

I feel like a living representation of attempted assimilation, and I hate living in Central Alberta, but it would be weird to try to move into my Grandfather’s home city when he left Egypt back in the ‘60s. Heck, it would be weird to move anywhere really. I can only speak English and if I leave Canada for good, I’m abandoning my family and leaving all of my Indigenous and POC comrades behind. The only prominent ML party I could think of that had a big positive impact in the United States or Canada was the Black Panthers, and even then, we get taught in school that they are a terrorist organization. I really want to stick it up to the institutions that have discriminated against me for my features and my autism, and I also want to bring down the beauty industry at least a peg or two. 

But then again, I need a group of people to help me. There is no great man in history because behind every great man was a large population that supported that man and was the movement that advocated for him. 

In an industrialized, Western, settler colonial country like Canada inside of a prairie province that relies entirely on fossil fuels and farming and has a long track record of fascist activity, how can I and a group of people address this? Is it a proper use of my time to support the most marginalized populations and to piss off white people or does it suck and I should just hit the bricks? 

I want global south citizens, BIPOC people and actual successful party organizers to talk to me and to give me advice, please and thank you. I would greatly appreciate it and would give you many blessings for it.",5971555499029508206,0

5534,ymkuk6,Economists say this isn’t another Great Depression. I agree—this is a Greater Depression.,"Humankind has more wealth and power in its possession than at any time in recorded history. Instead of uplifting the people who made and continue to make that possible, businesses and governments write workers off, blame them, and then forget about them. 

The media says people on the Left are “too woke” and out-of-touch. I can’t help but think of the irony; the media, which relies on its influence over “consumers” rests its laurels on the broken pillars of a failing government ready to make way for Q-Anon followers and Stop the Steal militiamen. 

While all of this foolishness plays out before us, no government stands up to address the deteriorating mental health of its people. We who survived COVID-19, we who live with the grim realities of economic catastrophe every 5 to 7 years. We who live with the reality of Right-Wing gunmen shooting up schools, houses of worship, and pushing their narratives of White Supremacy and Christian-Identity.

It doesn’t matter how much we compromise in our lives, or how much we attempt to appease our bosses, managers, and government—the fault rests with the worker. They will fire us. They will let us go. They will tell the public they have bad workers, “They were quiet quitting! No one wants to work anymore!” It will all be to appease their shareholders and customers—-they have to raise their prices while cutting down on labor costs. 

Yes, comrades—this is the Greater Depression. The managers of it are smiling because they know it’s rude to scowl. They can be certain of their victories before a battle has even begun. Their greatest asset is their ability to wield the chaos of their broken workers’ lives to fulfill an agenda bent to the benefit of the wealthy and powerful. 

All we really have is each other. Not as philosophers, political theoreticians, or pundits. As workers. As the Proletariat. We must unite to stand up to those who seek to exploit and use us. Not because we will assuredly win, but because we will have nothing to lose. One who is lost, cannot be found; the lost must find their own way. We will find our way.

Our natural determination, as able-bodied humans, to stand upright, is our noble defiance countering the forces that hold our feet to the ground. It is not shameful to demand respect, to appraise one’s own worth over profit, or to challenge the greed and wickedness of those who have more money than morality.",-5134496897682000192,0

Recently i was talking to my classmates, and we somehow got the conversation on this topic. A classmate of mine told me that Marx sold his books that he wrote questioning capitalism, and accumulated a good amount of capital with them, and those books were not freely distributed. In fact, he told me that Marx had a really high amount of capital for his place and time. I was pretty sure that he did distributed his books freely, and knowing that his informations are sometimes really dubious, i thought of questioning my teachers of History and Sociology about it. But today is Friday, and those specific teachers of mine were not present in the school today. Tried quickly searching about it on google, but i couldn't find anything really useful, so here am i, can someone answer my question and clarify those informations? Citing sources, if possible.

PS: I'm sorry about any writing mistakes, as i said, I'm Brazilian, so English is not my primary language.

PS²: If you are assuming that I think Marx should necessarily give his book for free, and the fact that he didn't do it (if he didn't) is an hypocrisy, and that it somehow refutes his own ideas, you are mistaken.

So, we’ve talked about unionising and had discussions with UNITE whilst some of our lab workers are already members of Prospect union which represents scientists and engineers etc.

The catch is that our company doesn’t recognise unions (surprise surprise). Now, I understand that by law we can apply for recognition and if the company refuses then we can get statutory recognition provided we have at least 10% of our bargaining unit paid union members and a majority of them in favour of recognition. 

My plan therefore is to recruit more members in the short term and build up a solid membership base in the manufacturing and lab departments of the company. I estimate that we can get ~80% of both of those departments paid union members which should provide us with a bargaining unit that the company cannot ignore. 

If anyone has any additional advice or thoughts on this please let me know. I would love to talk to other U.K. union members and particularly those at other pharma companies. Many thanks and solidarity to all ✊🚩",7753397941792040801,0

5572,yl2tue,"Reduced motivation for crimes, ""In a just and equitable human society""","In a just and equitable human society, there would be none marginalized, and therefore no motivation to break the established social contract and commit a crime. You would have to have a serious psychiatric condition to commit a crime in such an environment, so no prisons would theoretically be needed, but hospitals might. But that would require society as a whole to value all human life equally.

The establishment of new police forces or increasing police presence has never been statistically shown to have any relevant or beneficial impact on crime rates. The purpose of police departments are generally much more corrupt than crime control - they were first designed, formed, and funded in the US by factory and slave owners hoping for better \*social\* control of their respective labor forces. It wasn't until the 1830's that corporations or other organizations were first able to ""persuade"" local governments to fund their private militias (or ""enforcers"") with taxpayer dollars, to save money on enforcing the proper behavior of labor forces they desired further distance from. Corporations were so successful in their propaganda, that the original name for employees peacefully protesting for better working conditions is now considered far more derogatory ( a ""riot"" ), and they generally no longer even use this term but prefer to describe their actions as ""strikes"".

Similarly, studies have failed to find any significant correlation between incarceration rates and crime rates. 3 million Americans enslaved in prisons, and it's had no effect on crime rates, but has provided cheap slave labor. The 13th amendment luckily carves out a loophole in the ban on slavery and indentured servitude, allowing it for anyone convicted of a crime. We're also lucky that such great lawmakers were able to come up with some very creative new crimes specifically for people of color after the civil war reconstruction period ended, prohibition after WWI, a war on drugs after the civil rights era in the 60s, etc.

But the real key is that it's estimated that 3 out of every 4 incarcerated Americans has a severe psychiatric condition that has never been properly diagnosed or treated. The prisons keep these people safely off the streets where they could be costing taxpayer dollars to treat their various conditions.

5618,yipvi2,[Meta] The definition of lesser evilism...,"Recently a comment of mine on this subreddit stating that Lula was a preferable candidate to Jair Bolsonaro was removed for ""lesser evilism"", which makes me wonder precisely what counts as lesser evilism. The PT in Brazil are not a socialist party, but it may be fair to call them socialist-adjacent, or alternatively if they are social democrats then they are social democrats in a way more akin to the classical social democrats who had some modicum of representing the working classes (cf the Third Wayist social democrats such as Blair in Britain, Schroder in Germany, or Hollande in France). 

I agree that lesser evilism is generally unhelpful if it refers to supporting candidates or parties that are anti-socialist or totally non-socialist such as the Democrats in the US, or Labour in Britain under Keir Starmer, but PT in Brazil certainly contains some socialist elements. Where do we draw the line? Would someone who voted or campaigned for Jeremy Corbyn be excluded? What about someone who supported a Green or Génération.s candidate standing under the NUPES banner in France? 

I feel that the definition of lesser evilism adopted in this subreddit is potentially too narrow, and excludes a fair and open debate about the coalition-building necessary to sustain a genuine socialist movement. In the spirit of the Popular Front of the 1930s, I would argue that we have to be open to working with other groups in electoral politics and organising the working class more generally in order to defeat fascism and begin to shift people towards more socialist viewpoints, we socialists of the 21st Century cannot be a stick-in-the-mud like Ernst Thalmann and the KPD shouting into the void until it is too late. Many of you may disagree with my point of view, but it is not one which I feel it fair to exclude from this subreddit.

I hope that this will be considered in a spirit of sincerity and comradeship.",-3059237092776640077,0

Taking the view that Democrats and Republicans are essentially indistinguishable on matters of US imperialism, what do we make of the US signaling that they acknowledge Lula’s victory? Consider this against the plausible counterfactual where Trump is in office and uplifts reactionary electoral fraud conspiracies. I see the following possible options:

1. It is an impotent gesture that will do little to nothing in preventing a possible Bolsonaro coup.
2. Lula’s Brazil does not pose any real threat to the interests of US capital.
3. The US will simply undermine Lula in more surreptitious ways at a later date if his government makes any moves that threaten US interests.
4. The presence of a Democrat versus Republican in office can have a material  difference in shaping US imperialist policy.

But anyways I was making points about how moving to socialism would free people of their economic constraints like how people under feudalism were with capitalism when coworker brings up how Stalin was responsible for 60 million deaths and mao was responsible for 20 million deaths. Unfortunately I’m not well read on these two historical figures but I do know these numbers are gross overestimations which is what I said. Could someone explain to me the ways in which these two figures were based/not based? Who’s fault were the deaths? Were some of these deaths unjustified/justified? And Could someone educate me on this topic in general or give me some links to good research material? Thank you :)

5654,yharja,"Critique of The Black Book of Communism, and Bourgeois Democracy","**Critique of The Black Book of Communism, and Bourgeois Democracy**

The Black Book of Communism is an Academic piece of Scholarship written by multiple french scholars right? The book counts people who were part of the Nazi Army, let me remind you that the invasion of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics known as Operation Barbarossa was started by Nazi Germany, how can you count deaths that are defending the severity of a nation against fascism? You can’t. The book counts people who are never born as a “death”, In 1932 the soviet famine in Ukraine, Russia, Kazh has formed a new collectivization rule made by Comrade J. V. Stalin which would fail, some continue to debate it as genocide but I’d rather disagree as it is not only one ethnicity but multiple accidental famines for the majority of the soviet union, but back to the topic; the famine had caused a significant loss of births, “If a woman should have had 4 children, but only had 2 because having children in a famine is not a good idea, is the 2 children who were never born technically dead?” No, they were never born so how would one die? Let's apply the same thing to the US and the number might reach 20 billion. So it is just pure Bullshit. It counts deaths caused by the US starting the 2nd Indochina war (Vietnam war), and illegal undemocratic war against Vietnam are counted as deaths of “communism” when the US started the war against Vietnamese people. Now I see many of you screaming about the Khmer Rouge. Historians **Jens Mecklenburg and Wolfgang Wippermann** wrote that a connection between the events in Pol Pot's Cambodia and Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union are far from evident and that Pol Pot's study of Marxism in Paris is insufficient for connecting radical Soviet industrialism and the Khmer Rouge's murderous anti-urbanism under the same category. From the book - ***A 'Red Holocaust'? A Critique of the Black Book of Communism***. Pol Pot is a person who did not understand the meaning of communism let alone should we call him a socialist? No. Now the book is extremely about comparing the Nazis with the same soviets. Which is just pure idiocracy when you realize who defeated who. But According to Werth, there was still a qualitative difference between Communism and Nazism, stating: ""Death camps did not exist in the Soviet Union."" - [***The Future Did Not Work***](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/03/the-future-did-not-work/378081/). To quote the same article: 

*The geopolitical accident of its alliance with the Western democracies against Hitler created a wartime illusion of the Soviet Union as a democracy. The universal revulsion for the Nazis enabled the Communists for many years to enjoy a reputation for anti-fascism and thereby evade scrutiny or objective evaluation by Western intellectuals, who yearned for social justice, were made uncomfortable by capitalist materialism, and felt moral outrage against fascism.*

The US had supported the USSR by calling them democratic, why? Because it was a joint fight against fascism and because the US agreed they were democratic. 

Now let's get to the topic of East and West Germany. Many people see Stalin as an aggressive agitator and divider of Germany not agreeing to “Democracy”. Has told in the sentence before was completely foolish. To quote and refer to [***Stalin’s Note***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalin_Note) in which he called for democratic reunification of GDR and GR via democracy and to place 

*“the rights of man and basic freedoms, including freedom of speech, press, religious persuasion, political conviction, and assembly"" and free activity of democratic parties and organizations.*

Stalin’s note was in vain when the US, UK, and France would decline the offer, such democracy isn’t it? The whole Black Book of Communism and Democracy points are debunked coming to what I have written till now. 

What is the difference between “Bourgeois and Proletarian Democracy?” 

Good question, Bourgeois Democracy is the concept of multiple (Ironically) political parties being voted, but there is one major flaw of this concept. All politicians (well most) have a ton of money compared to the non-revisionist Socialist parties, why? Well corruption in third world nations like India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan or Just generational wealth in 1st world nations like the US. No man can become the president without massive wealth for campaigning, speeches, rallies, etc as it requires wealth from multiple sources. Political parties get the wealth from tax benefits to gold schemes, and all of this money is given to media companies to write about them. Remember that the media’s job is not, to tell the truth, but to get money. This creates an economically motivated bias against a certain political party causing a dictatorship from corruption. The only solution against Bourgeois democracy is Proletarian Democracy. So what is proletarian democracy? Well, what western media has told us one truth is single-party democracy. A single political party not at all influenced by money winning votes against people with the same ideas is better as this individual democracy can be exploited by rich and corrupt politicians. A famous nation with such a democracy was the USSR. Who was very much democratic. - [***1936 Constitution of The U.S S.R***](https://www.marxists.org/history/ussr/government/constitution/1936/1936-constitution.pdf).

Three of them sat quietly while the rest of us carried on.

Pressed a bit further (not aggressively; very pleasantly), they claimed that they do care about these subjects, ""probably don't know as much as they should about them,"" ultimately tapping out by saying ""Why should I care? I can't do anything about this stuff anyway.""

I always have trouble counterarguing this frame of mind. Two of these three people work 60+ hour weeks in kitchens, so the ""attend a town council meeting"" and ""join an organization that shares your values"" is easier said then done.

I have no sympathy for Kanye or his nazi propaganda, of course, but this is a demonstration of the power that the capitalist class have to discipline their own. The moment a billionaire becomes a threat  to their peers, they will find themselves cut off from the power their wealth represents.

It's well understood that capitalists maintain class solidarity out of self interest, but that leaves opportunity for there to be at least a few ""good"" billionaires. Odds are that at least a few heirs of oil barons would have a heart, and want to use their resources for good, right? 

A corporation will fire a nazi, but they will shut down entire stores to stop unions. 

Bill Gates dumps barrels of cash into world health, while simultaneously using his weight to keep covid vaccine patents privately owned. Is his philanthropy a cynical way to help himself and his class, or does he help his class so he can continue to do philanthropy? Is there meaningful difference? 

There's no good cops, because a cop doing good within the system is promptly fired. The same is true for billionaires. When we describe billionaires, don't simply say they choose to help themselves over workers. Explain that they don't have the choice.

The show is instead based in the 1980s during the Cold War and it’s centered around a husband/wife spy duo from the USSR living in the states. 

The show was created by a former CIA agent and has had Oliver North assist with an episode. My issue is that the moral ambiguity of show really tries to make you question the validity of the main characters’ actions and as a leftist with USSR sympathies, I’m of course watching charitably. 

For those who have seen the show, is there something more latently nefarious about it that I’m not seeing? It’s the first show I’ve watched that grants a narrative from a soviet POV and I interpret most of the depictions pretty favorably (so far at least).

5677,yg152j,So I recently started reading Bernstein...,"Eduard Bernstein is considered the Ur-Revisionist in the world of Marxism. The ultimate distorter of Marx and Engels's ideological work. Unlike heterodox Marxists like Jean Jaures, Bernstein actively subverted Marxist goals by using Marxist terminology. 

But I realized that, until recently, I had never actually read this man's work or what he actually had to say, simply taking Lenin's word for it. So I decided to actually start doing some reading...

...And what I learned is that Lenin was 100% right about him. Holy *Shit.*

Bernstein will start off very well. He'll speak of things that any good Marxist would agree with...and then completely veer off into something absolutely nonsensical and down right asinine. ""Countries should be cosmopolitan and have lots of civil liberties and individual freedoms..."". Yeah, OK, I can get behind that. I believe the same. ""...which is why we need to subjugate the s\*vages who are incapable of building civilization"". Wait, what the fuck?

(I'm obviously paraphrasing here, but not by much).

What I've come to realize is that a glaring flaw of early Marxism is that, due to the gaps in its formative years, it could easily be subverted into being used to justify colonialism and imperialism. Bernstein is proof of that.",504145535965031758,0

5683,yflg9f,Narcissism in the military.,"I know every military is like this to an extent, but the US and Britain really just take it to a whole other level. They're *always* in the right, no matter how low they stoop. I mean, you drop two nukes and level two cities, but they're ""military targets"" so it's okay. Criticise the use of atomic bombs and you get called a revisionist, but the whole idea that those bombs actually ""saved millions of lives"" wasn't even invented till 1947. The closest the people of those cities have ever got to an apology was one of the crew of the enola gay hug a survivor and cry about how hard it was for him to do and he's so sorry they had to drop that bomb. Said survivor lost both his sister and mother to those bombs.

I even had a narcissistic Iraq veteran tell me Japan is thriving now *because* America dropped those bombs. She then tried to justify the Iraq war because, uh, Saddam bad! Unbelievable. And those bombs were okay because Japan did bad things, but if you point out the crimes America commited in Vietnam, you get hit with tons of responses telling you the Vietcong also did bad things! And when they killed civilians it was because they used to hide in villages so it wasn't America's fault. And when they kill children in the middle East, it's collateral damage and the reason Iraq hates the US is because of their religion, not because they destroyed their country. These are all real arguments I've heard soldiers make. It's unreal.

Literally, I seen a video before of a marine burst into tears and *literally* get down on his knees thanking another enola gay crew member for saving his life. It was the most pathetic display of boot licking I've ever seen, second only to a third cousin I've only met a handful of times thanking my stepmother for cremating my sister's body against her wishes. But that's a rant for another time and another sub. Anyway, getting back to the military, it always pisses me off when soldiers proudly brag that the atom bombs saved their lives. A have a bit of sympathy for the ones that got drafted, but if you enlist in the military, especially army or marines, you should be prepared for the worst. You hear about soldiers putting their lives on the line to protect people, but when they had to choose between children who's only crime was being Japanese and living there at the time, they selfishly sacrifice innocent lives.

I know not all veterans and soldiers are like this. I recently talked about how angry I was that my mother was away for years in the royal navy, but to her credit, she's become like a full blown anti war pacifist. So I appreciate the ones like her who eventually see through the whole charade. My great grandpa who died before I was born even fought the Japanese in Burma and even he always said that as bad as their army were, he drew a line at killing so many innocent people, so props to him. I've heard Americans brag about how they levelled that entire country and nuked them and they deserved it because of pearl harbor, and that Afghanistan should consider themselves lucky they weren't carpet bombed and nuked after 9/11. What the fuck? How do people even get away with saying that shit? If you tried justifying the London blitz because of the British empires crimes, you'd be condemned for it and rightly so because the people of London were innocent. But if Britain, America, or any NATO country bombs somewhere else, then it's okay because no matter what the west does, they're always the ""good guys.""",-4445064226082769774,0

My issue is this :
Everytime someone calls out how shitty and destructive capitalism and neoliberalism are, there's always some working class-people ready to defend their oppressors.
People who aren't rich but chose to identify and thus align with the rich.
Clearly this is the result of well-placed propaganda :
The poor are parasites and evil and to blame for all your problems, or :
you can be just like us if you keep working hard! 
I am honestly depressed seeing how deeply entrenched neoliberal propaganda is in our culture.
Billionaires are lauded as hard-working geniuses, whereas poor people working 50 hrs/week are considered worthless and lazy.
Now, is there any data or theory on (billionaire)-bootlicking?
Is there a more scientific term?
'Person who acts against their self- and class-interest in hopes of one day becoming the oppressor' sounds lame.
How prevalent, and therefore problematic is this billionaire-/rich-worshipping, violently anti-social and individualistic mindset in modern culture and society?
How should the left react to such workers who identify as rich, even if this is completely detached from reality?
Talking to them about the consequences of capitalism is hard (unsurprisingly) if they feel like they belong to the profiteers/upper class when this clearly isn't the case. 
These people are trained to reject the idea of belonging to the ""commoners"", sadly.

5732,ycu5bd,Are Superheroes Just Neoliberal Power-fantasies?,"     I’ve been reading superhero comics and watching superhero films my entire life. As I’ve gotten older and my politics evolve so does my understanding of the subtext embedded into art and popular media. Therein I’ve begun to understand as I now believe all should that art is political and it isn’t possible to separate the two, especially regarding my childhood (deeply political in nature) favorite superhero stories. My question here is being asked in hopes of furthering my knowledge of the intersection between politics and art. 

     Is the concept of a superhero in the modern age inherently tied to power fantasy filtered through neoliberal spectacle and perception of the world? To give context I find Marvel films most alarming in their biases, not only because they’re often likened to militaristic propaganda but because the ways in which they decry leftism and glorify global capitalism are frequent. The Avengers are constantly interfering with foreign affairs, and the villains of Black Panther and Falcon and the Winter Soldier are apparent bad faith attempts at creating delineations of leftists and using them as scapegoats for oppression in the name of a “misguided” benevolence when the real solution lies in the heroes pro-police UN-backed centrist liberal democracy. As a leftist, the didactic nature of these films and comic books when it comes to pushing for “good billionaires” or insistence that interventionist foreign policy is great (ironically while attempting to critique it) is rather disturbing considering these are supposed to serve as morality tales for feverous fans consisting of mostly impressionable kids and young folks.

     Perhaps I’m just rattling off the examples of most poor taste in the catalog but it’s hard to ignore when my favorite Marvel character Spider-Man’s debut outing in the MCU involved a Tony Stark mentored Peter mostly stripped of his status as the working class hero being handed state-of-the-art tech to beat up fellow working-class laborers that were screwed over by his billionaire buddy and positioning Keaton’s character as the bad guy for trying to take back what he needs to provide for his family and then get thrown in prison for doing so (Something these things aren’t shy about doing whatsoever.) However, on the other side of the aisle, I’ve seen fellow leftist film enjoyers hail Zack Snyder’s “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” as (both intentionally and unintentionally) a humanist masterpiece that studies the manifestation of trauma, the inherent fascism, and religious subtext of superheroes as mythological figures in contemporary society, using pop culture to explore the corruption of government and godlike figures, and finding humanity in our shared pain as people. They’re very profound readings that strike a chord with the things I believe superheroes and other fantasy should be: mythical representations of the human condition. I think this is very well represented by Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man trilogy as well. 

     So with all that being said is there something about superheroes and their commitment to truth, justice, and the American way that will manifest a reflection of America’s true values being the current cultural zeitgeist? Is it an inevitable pitfall because America is so steeped in capitalist dogma so our art is naturally going to reflect this? Or is it just that the writers of comics and superhero media with a few exceptions like Alan Moore have failed to create meaningful conduits for discussions about things like race, gender, social, and economic inequalities because their worldviews inherently neglect to account for class dynamics, effective solutions to systemic prejudices, etc? 

     What superheroes or superhero stories are most guilty/not guilty of this? How do we as leftists navigate through these things and decipher what is legitimate expressions of human perspective and what is just reinforcing dogma that is really antithetical to egalitarian beliefs? Will we ever see superheroes with true leftist beliefs and stories with insights beyond throwing everyone from drug dealers to petty thieves into the slammer whilst never questioning those who sit in positions of power?

5737,ydg0rm,I am confused by the mainstream opinions here about China,"I am a normal citizen of China and currently studying in Canada. I read several posts here about China, but I am deeply confused, as many people seems have a total different views on China than me, they think China is a socialist country and doing a great job developing the country in keeping with Marxism.

I don't want to offend people here, but this opinion seems to be very wrong to me. In my view, China is a very reactionary country, which do not respect workers right at all. Here are several examples.

1. Although China has a very good Labor Law, most companies don't follow it and the government will not punish these companies for violating the law. Like the notorious [996 working hour system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/996_working_hour_system), workers need to work from 9am to 9pm, 6 days per week without extra pay;  i.e. 72 hours per week.  There are many people who protested against it on GitHub ([https://github.com/996icu/996.ICU](https://github.com/996icu/996.ICU)), which is an American website, as the posts protesting 996 were simply removed from Chinese websites. Even if the 996 working hour system violated the Labor Law, nothing has been done by the government to stop it. The workers are still being exploited.
2. The government oppress the workers' protests and doesn't respect workers' right. In 2010, due to the working conditions and low pay, there were [14 workers suicided](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn_suicides) in the same year in the same factory. But the government did nothing to improve the working conditions.
3. In 2018, some workers organized [strikes against Jasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasic_incident) because of the working conditions, and many students in universities supported these workers. However, these workers were beaten and arrested by the police, these students were threatened by the school, and some of them **disappeared**. There was one student named [Yue Xin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yue_Xin_(activist)), who was studying at Peking University (the top university in China ) at that time. Because she supported the workers and organized strikes with these workers, she disappeared on 23 August 2018 and no one knows where she is now. Zizek also wrote an [article](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/china-missing-marxists-communists-dissidents-students-beijing-peking-university-a8657621.html) about her disappearance. She is a genuine Marxist and did a lot of things for workers, but this is the result of supporting workers in China.

There are many many other examples.

Since I was a child in primary school, I have been taught that socialism is good, and capitalism is bad. But, the truth seems to be the opposite, and workers in capitalist countries have more rights than workers in China as the Chinese government wants cheap labor to boost the export and the economy. Most people I know don't believe in socialism at all, and myself is also disillusioned.

A lot of people in the subreddit seem truly believe China is a socialist country. However, How can a country that doesn't protect workers' right and stands with corporation be a socialist country? I really don't want to offend people here. But, Could someone help me why there are many people have such opinions?

5766,ybidit,Questions for Chinese People," I am currently in China and will be spending some time here making some observations for personal research. Please leave in the comments any questions you would like me to ask Chinese people. Certain questions involving deep knowledge of theory (e.g. what do you think of Trotsky) I will try to ask officials and professors who should theoretically be able to answer. Other questions that do not involve anything complex (what do you think of this controversy reported in Western media?) I will ask normal people. Please do not ask me for personal information. I will not answer.

After spending a bit of time here, my initial impression is that China is indeed a ""third world country"" in every sense of the word. The g7 are put on a pedestal. White people from the G7 are treated like celebrities to varying degrees. The ""rise of xenophobia"" BS you see on the internet is nonsense. Living conditions are similar to other poor countries, the big exceptions are infrastructure and safety, which are better than most countries.

There is immense confusion as regards Marxist theory. I visited a university. The professors are split between bourgeois theory (which is euphemistically referred to as mainstream theory) and Marxist theory (most seem to be supporting the former). Those supporting the former are obviously anti-communists, but for obvious reasons do not directly speak out against the government. I assume that politically they are a mix between ""reformers"" and counter-revolutionaries.

The Marxists (professional academic ones) are eclectic. Karl Marx once said, ""The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e. the class which is the ruling material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectual force."" The leading material and therefore intellectual force today globally is undoubtedly the American bourgeoisie. Universities all around the world (including China) use American textbooks in the social science curriculums. This is already a bit shocking for those who don't know better. What genuinely shocked me was to find Marxists agreeing with and promoting David Harvey, Paul Sweezy, and Modern Monetary Theory (this last one does not even pretend to be Marxist)! I used to think Western Marxism was only of interest to petite-bourgeois academics in the West. I was wrong.

The countries targeted by the G7 in today's world often have reactionary political/economic systems. This leads to confusion among the left (e.g. what should the left's stance be toward the Syrian government?). The confusion stems from the fact that the country's position may be progressive from the standpoint of the global economic system, but the same country can have regressive domestic policies. There is even more confusion regarding China since it is ruled by the CPC. To be fair, the Chinese people themselves are also confused. Chinese students are confused as to why, despite the fact that their country's official ideology is Marxism-Leninism, anti-Marxist theories are predominant in universities. Knowledge of contemporary imperialism (either in the liberal sense of military aggression or the Leninist sense) is almost non-existent among ordinary people and even party officials. I once met a CPC member who works in government who had never read the Communist Manifesto ( this member had time to study abroad in England however!) Despite this, Xi Jinping in one of his recent journal articles wrote something along the lines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin did not expect that we would have to manage a socialist market...We are still revolutionaries and must uphold our revolutionary tradition. Propaganda that supports socialism is also everywhere. Occasionally I even hear on the street a siren reminding people to remember socialist values.

Unfortunately, it has been my experience that anybody critical towards the CPC leans towards liberalism. Many of these people are confused as opposed to being genuine reactionaries. When I start explaining basic Marxist concepts to them, they are instantly fully supportive (in contradistinction to many Westerners who are taught to despise communism).

Finally, I will say that our situation objectively right now is not great. Since the fall of the USSR (arguably since the late 1950s), the global left has been theoretically confused and pessimistic about the future. China is not an exception to this rule. It is my hope that the young generation can make the final push towards human liberation. Anyone who has anything positive to say about developments in other countries please leave it in the comments.",3606734587620841028,0

5803,y90dwh,A Socialist in Miami,"I recently moved to Miami to escape fridges cold winters of Minnesota and Wisconsin. I have long dreamed of settling in a land of eternal sunshine since a young age, and after living for two years in Brazil, I couldn't allow myself to be stuck in the north's tundra any longer. If it weren't for challenges with visa restrictions in Brazil, I would have stayed but forced back to the motherland, and I found Miami to be the closest thing to my Latin American home.

I found work as a bartender in a popular area of the city and started dating a Cuban American woman. Now, I hold a degree in Political Sciences focusing on Latin America, with retired dreams of working for the State Department or the United Nations. Both were abandoned since I couldn't stomach working for my country when I didn't support most of its international policy. Along with their power in the UN prevents any form of progressive action as a veto power in the Security Council.

I'm well educated on international relations and the history of the Cuban government. Thus, it was no surprise to me that most of Miami's population is fearful of anything that closely resembles a government their families immigrated to escape from. In their eyes, socialism IS communism. So, I do as President Theodore Roosevelt did, and ""speak softly and carry a big stick."" 

I do, on occasion, open a conversation regarding politics with coworkers and friends. Mostly remaining curious about their ideologies and only softly questioning the simple point of view. However, this week I slipped. I was outed, resulting in a weird mixed bag of reactions. 

The conversation was one of the most basic and standard arguments. Free education. It started with Biden's $20,000 student loan forgiveness, which I commented I'd happily take, but I wish it were more. It was as if a spotlight was put on me. ""Why should WE have to pay for everyone's education?"" Was the response. I would happily pay my share if it meant everyone had access to the education they wanted. Of course, some rules would still need to be in place, such as minimum grades and the number of degrees one could take before some fee was activated. (I have friends in Germany that have long overstayed their tenure only to take advantage of student benefits provided by the state.) Besides, what is so bad about a plan for a free to primarily free higher education system when we already practice this in our k-12 systems? 

The arguments poured in. Someone argued they shouldn't be forced to pay it unless everyone pays their taxes. Fair fight, but who isn't paying their taxes, I questioned. The US office of accountability is very open that households in our group's income level are audited five times more than ""above middle class"" households by the IRS. A simple search would find pages of evidence suggesting that the ""above middle class"" don't pay their share. Ironically, some defended the rich. A clear sign I needed to back out of this conversation as it was about to go nowhere progressive. 

""I probably want EVERYONE to pay for free healthcare too."" Someone else suggested. I can't hold my tongue now. I've gone too far. I try to speak softly, but now I want to swing that big stick I carry, regardless if I know it's useless against ignorance. 

The next day, I walk into work, and I'm greeted by a coworker not present for last night's conversation. ""How you doing socialist?"" He says it in a joking manner.

5816,y8wdkk,My case against electoralism/voting.,"I've seen a rise in electoralism in leftist spaces in recent times, I think no doubt to people like Contra et al, but I'd like to state a few reasons for why the whole electoral game is bankrupt due to scale and inherent contradictions.

&#x200B;

1. It requires enormous energy and investment to win.

Voting isn't simply about the individual votes, on the scale of a national or regional election you're talking thousands if not millions of votes. That's why parties instead focus more on the voting blocks to garner support. For this you need a lot of time and money and labour to succeed and get your candidate in the running. In other words you need a very well organised and costly campaign that may not necessarily succeed.

Socialists should not be looking towards entering this system that is very susceptible to corruption, opportunism, and inefficiencies over time. Rather invest their labour and money in other direct action ventures that can challenge the system and maybe by a secondary measure influence electoral politics. The ultimate truth of electoralism is 'If you don't CAMPAIGN, you can't COMPLAIN' because in order for the candidate to get ANYWHERE there needs to be lots of funding and organising behind it to get a mass group of people voting for you. And for that, it requires you engage in that campaign to make it work, not JUST VOTE.

&#x200B;

2. Social change comes from the societal conditions first and foremost.

People often state that the more left wing candidate will be able to be more effective when it comes to workers rights and change. Yet as we can see throughout history this was more due to the circumstances involved. The New Deal came in response to the crashed economy, the post war reforms in the UK were held by both parties, there was far greater organised labour to bargain, and many repressed groups were also fighting for their say in the nation's affairs.

The rise of Reagan and Thatcher was a response to the downturn in the economy and a need for reshuffling in order to sustain profiteering into the future.  

It’s not to say that history is deterministic, but that the change doesn’t occur at electorate level, it's always driven by much larger factors. Gay marriage, The renters reform bill, and even ACORN UK all came about, or were funded  by initiatives from… a tory government. And now it appears like they're on the way out.

3. The goals and aims of the left are not the same as the right.

The right-wings gains from electoralism are always used as a reason for why the left should engage more with electoral politics and win elections, if they can do it, so should we.

Ignoring what I said in part 1, or that we don't have as much money, lets also remember that the instrument that sustains the system, will not be very effective as a means to destroy it. The right can always lean on the status quo ante and bolster it, the left on the other hand has the much harder job of destroying the very roots of that system. Part of why the left is so divided is because everyone has different ideas about how to go about this and what society should look like, the right already has the foundations of that set firmly, it just needs to retreat to them, hence they tend to get along without too many arguments.

4. It creates opportunism and stagnation.

People might think that a more left centre politician might create a greater avenue for making change, however often the electoral game simply co-opts and recuperates these issues.

Roe vs Wade being overturned for example allows the perfect opportunity for Democrats to bring people into the political game and give themselves a career boost. In other words, the injustice becomes an opportunity, in the same way that many charities depend upon the problems they intend to solve in order to exist.

Similarly, having a strong Conservative party allows the Scottish National Party to scapegoat their problems onto them. If Scotland were independent that would be much harder to do. I'm not saying that's the reason they don't attempt an independence referendum again, but its understandable to see why they wouldn't attempt to remove all doubt, especially when you notice what happened to the Liberal Democrats when they shared power.

It's easy to see why if a left-wing politician were to gain power that the situation would simply become a matter of them sustaining power whilst implementing small reforms here and there, whilst beating off more radical groups and energies that wish to go further.

&#x200B;

5. It destroys the focus on the left from radical aims into a door-to-door canvasing endeavour.

I'll just let Libcom explain this better than I can.

 Every criticism of 'abolish the family' as a slogan imagines the socialist as stranger, no connection to their listener who has little/no prior knowledge and disengages when they hear something they don't like (rather than ask Qs): this is the doorstep socialism of electoralism 

 Might these be conversations with friends/workmates? Long term relationships where people say ""well, they might be a mad bastard but not all wrong""? No, just ""what would they say if I knocked the door and said 'I'm campaigning for X; how do you feel about abolishing the family'?"" 

 This is politics imagined as an elevator pitch: if you don't immediately say what the stranger wants to hear, they'll close the door on you. If that's your politics, ok; but that's not the end of socialist ideas (let alone activity!) 

 Point is, if you have radical politics, you're always gonna be a bit of an outlier. But the point of socialism/communism/whatever politics is to build relationships & your non-politico mates/workmates (fuck, even your fellow activists!) don't have to swallow your worldview whole   


&#x200B;

6. It's not as simple as 'Do both'

The argument that 'WE CAN DO BOTH' is complicated by the fact that its always weighted on the reformist side.

A line has emerged in recent times - ""Do radical actions WHEN they come about, Do reform IN THE MEANTIME"" which is probably one of the more impoverished statements I've ever heard.

If we actually want to move things forward we have to create the circumstances for those radical actions, and perhaps do reform as a side activity if it is clear and convenient (referendums). So the statement should be ""Do reform WHEN things come about, Do Radical Actions IN THE MEAN TIME!""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What I will say though is that voter apathy only works if that apathy is being funnelled into a different channel, Not voting alone doesn't change the system either. So other avenues need to be created in order for that to work. The problem is people simply insist ""Oh we don't have those yet"" which becomes a self-fulfilling philosophy that basically amounts to ""We won't ever have them"" because such people are not interested in developing the bases in the first place... because they don't exist.",-8497213661322507460,0

Now they're acting like the big humanitarian with Russia, acting like the give a shit about the people of Ukraine when the war was caused or at least escalated by them and NATO.

Do they expect Iran to be on their side? It really pisses me off, when multiple presidential candidates threatened to start a war with them, and Trump fired missiles at them. And now they wonder why Iran is pro Russia. Now, I'm not pro Russia anymore than I'm pro NATO.

I am in Toronto studying as an internal student (I'm from the US) in Canada and really want to join an explicitly communist/socialist org either now or after I get my citizenship (I also wonder if it will be a problem if I do it before). With that aside The ones I'm aware of are as follows:

1: [Socialist Action Canada](https://socialistaction.ca/)\- I had seen their posters around for a while and I got to meet them in person, as they attended a university protest I was part of that specifically wanted to force the university to change its SA policies -  since they abuse survivors and don't actually do anything about predators etc- and they had set up a little booth. I will say their presence there felt a bit off since they were noticeably older (out of the 4-5 people two were absolutely adults and the other two I have no idea) and carrying flags, sorta apart from the group which felt like they were kinda crashing this small protest but I don't know what went on behind the scenes. The only other things worth noting is that they seem to be Trotskyists and in their [Municipal Socialist Alliance](https://municipal.socialistalliance.ca/) platform they are advancing they advocate eliminating taxes on small businesses (somewhat suspicious). They also support joining the NDP social caucus so they may be essentially one org but I don't want to jump the gun. All that said they seem to be the most active in the community so I currently am leaning their way.

2: [The Socialist Party of Canada (WSM)](https://canadasocialistparty.ca/) \- I think I may have seen some members during a protest for action against climate change but I can't quite remember. And I do know that they put up posters at least last year. I just don't know a ton about them. One red flag is that I wanted to link their website here and it isn't working...

3: [The Communist Party of Canada](https://communist-party.ca/)\- I have seen their posters more last year but this year too. I can't say much else really I don't think I've seen them in person.

4: [The NDP Socialist Caucus](https://ndpsocialists.ca/) \- A wing of the NDP, or New Democratic Party, (which everybody agrees is not a socialist party) that wishes to transform it into a proletarian party. The obvious strength is that the NDP is a fairly large party, and does have some serious swing. They are also supported by the aforementioned Socialist Action Canada.

5: [Fightback](https://www.marxist.ca/) \- the Canadian wing of the International Marxist Tendency (Trotskyist). Although technically a publication/newsletter I have seen a number of events they've hosted and they put posters around. I can say with confidence they are active.

Hopefully, I didn't miss any and I don't want to cause fighting over which groups yall like I am just trying to shield myself from big mistakes. I know Canada may be different but at least in the US many socialist parties kinda blow at least on the national level. Thanks in advance :)",-8869741986097733114,0

I appreciate their work in general, but idk. I meant to post this as a reply to another post, but that one got locked. I tried posting there and on /r/communism, and I was blocked from doing so (as if I was some untrustworthy reactionary for daring to asking about minority populations in China). If I get banned here too, so be it.

The question was asking about the Uyghur situation in China. 

I have a number of articles that do disprove some of the West’s statements regarding the Uyghur situation. **I’ve read article after article, some from Western sources, some from Eastern sources. I’ve dug through threads in this sub and others.** And since we’re talking sources, I’d like to point out that those cited by the West were sometimes handwritten by DoD goons. The West is 100% propagandizing this. I’m not a lib. I fully understand this.

I’m generally supportive of China. Don’t get me wrong. But, and there is a but, the situation seems more complicated to me. 

Now, it’s been a couple months since I read up on this. But I remember reading that the Uyghur population have minority benefits, and are in a number of leadership positions in the region. However, there has been some violence and crime from the Uyghurs, leading to some of them being imprisoned, just like the West AFAIK. People commit crimes, they go to jail. Ok.

But, I’ve seen some footage of China, from the Xinjiang region, and elsewhere of course. Yes, those who produced the footage are biased and are pushing a Western narrative. Yes, some of the videos are of normal prisons, or random, unrelated bs. But, some of the footage I’ve seen — of not just Xinjiang but of China in general — seemed extremely credible, authentic, dystopian, and scary at times. The US and other Western nations share similarities. Anyway, I won’t glorify China. I support them. But I’m not an evangelical. I’m skeptical at times. I won’t speak on this more, fearing another ban. 

Hopefully others can shine an honest light on this situation. I’ve looked at the other posts on this topic, within this subreddit and a couple others. There’s a lot of great info, but at the end of the day, it seems some people are hand waving it away entirely. I’ll reiterate: Western sources on this topic are false, biased, and propagandized in many ways. However, it seems to me that the situation is more complicated than “The West made it all up.” 

I’m a well read Marxist-Leninist. Over the last year I’ve been reading up on Mao and Chinese history. But with this is a topic, I can’t seem to get a straight, honest explanation. It’s either libs/conservatives saying “It’s just like the holocaust!!!!!” or commies saying “The West is just pushing propaganda again!” Maybe it’s my ignorance of China as a white man in the imperial core, but it seems the politics around the Uyghur population is somewhat complicated.

The aforementioned ‘patterns’ were always the lack of a sufficient numbers of employees; petty managers/supervisors who acted as if the workplace was a hierarchy; overall unfairness (e.g, managers not doing shit); and being severely under-compensated.

It is the age old divide and conquer strategy being applied to modern communications technologies. If there was a collectively congruent use of the language, then an actual conversation and exchange of ideas is able to happen.

There is a lack distinction made when discussing various political, social, and economic models, often comparing categorically different concepts to each other.There is little to no knowledge of the true meaning and definition of many words used or a true understanding of many concepts discussed.

A few of the key words that are being corrupted and manipulated are communism, socialism, facism, and capitalism. A couple of words that don’t seem to be used enough are authoritarianism and corporatism. 

Communism and socialism are conflated with authoritarianism. Capitalism gets conflated with libertarianism/anarchism. Capitalism gets conflated with democracy. I’m sure there are conflations I’m missing.

They have abandoned even the pretense of decency and rationality. They refuse to hear any criticism of a rampantly racist and comically corrupt ""democracy"" that they likely still couldn't point to on a map. Anyone who does criticize Ukraine is accused of being a subversive agent of Russian propaganda.

5941,y1erbc,Checking my understanding of Baran and Sweezy's Monopoly Capital,"So, basically I want to make sure my understanding of their argument that monopoly capitalism leads to stagnation is more or less correct.

Ok basically, monopoly capitalism creates the conditions where the economic surplus tends to rise. Why? Because capitalists enjoying monopoly profits cannot consume all of the produced surplus, there's just too much. So, the surplus must be reinvested or wasted. Reinvestment leads to increased productive capacity, which then is reinvested again leading to ever more productive capacity and shrinking consumption. This, when left to its own devices, will lead to stagnation. 

Why? Because clearly infinite reinvestment cannot work, there isn't sufficient demand or resources for it.  This means that capital MUST be underutilized, because if utilized to full capacity, then commodities will be produced for which there is no demand and as such will sit around taking up space and costing the capitalist money. Plus, there's no real reason to produce for which there is no demand.

Since capital is underutilized, unemployment will rise as less labor is needed. At a certain point, productive capacity falls back to levels where demand is actually met, and this allows for profitable reinvestment opportunities in trying to lower costs to meet this demand, but then you get the same cycle all over again, and so you're back to stagnation.

To stabilize this system and prevent stagnation, the surplus must be wasted. The sales effort takes part of this, but it isn't enough. Domestic spending can also cover part of this but capitalist class interests oppose this. So we're left with military expenditures and imperialism.

Is this more or less correct?",-5324070896995440708,0

Today, in a debate with my history teacher, we were talking about the results of the elections, about the United States, about the Cuban Revolution until we got to the Chinese Communist Revolution, where I commented that Mao had affected his country, because of his plans and their consequences, in this case, the episode of the Great Famine. In that, he told me that this event occurred because of the United States, because of an embargo they gave in China, since they were in the Cold War era. I was surprised by what he said because, I had never read about it, I told him I would research more about this information, but I didn't find ANYTHING. I searched all possible sites, even the most ''unknown''. Does anyone know anything about this? Is this information true?

6023,xxb4b3,What do y'all think of OPEC?,"Bernie Sanders tweeted this morning (link below) that the United States must ""end OPEC's illegal price-fixing cartel.""

Some aspects to the question that I'm considering:

\- OPEC's potential to strengthen the economy of developing nations

\- The concentration of wealth among political elites in OPEC nations (notoriously pronounced in the Emirates)

\-  Institutional opposition to bourgeois democracy in OPEC nations

\- The power dynamics between buyer and supplier (i.e., Hussein's attempt to enforce OPEC standards in Kuwait and the United States' military response).

&#x200B;

My stance is that OPEC benefits socialists insofar as it creates solidarity among previously colonized countries and allows a potent force in global opposition to United States hegemony to develop. Whether OPEC nations strive to implement a socialist ideal and dissolve class hierarchy is a red herring, as the liberation of the working class is not necessarily contingent upon OPEC's dissolution. To that end, while valid criticism of any OPEC nation is legitimate and necessary for growth, I also detest glib smear campaigns that decry governments that deviate from United States policy. If someone takes offense at how the KSA conducts its internal affairs only when Saudi policy vitiates the effect of sanctions against Russia, it calls into question the sincerity and actual implications of those criticisms.

You’ll get that is us who are driving the backbone of this country. It is us that are driving your ambulances, sweeping your roads, stocking your shelves, nursing you into good health, getting people to work.

We will pick you up when you are down…we are the security and the prosperity of this nation. 

Yet, as they urged the public to step outside of their doors and clap for us, they were giving us pay cuts at the very same time. 

Their contempt for workers of this country has gone too far and now we’re realising who’s really in control. It’s time to stand up. It’s time to come together and to organise. We cannot do this alone. United we stand but divided we fall. 

It’s not about just pay, it’s about justice…and those that cannot fight for themselves” ✊

We are being treated as second-class citizens in our own country as we always have. The white political elite only cares about us during election season. I think that Biden should be the last democratic President we vote for without guaranteed concessions. The need for a Black Nationalist Party is now.

I live in Prince George’s County, Maryland. One of the most influential black counties in the States. While well off compared to others we still are given the worst possible education with our teachers being underfunded and the school system is ranked 2nd worst in the state. Our County is deeply corrupt. The local politicians near all democrats have run it into the ground. The bus drivers and teachers must go down to budget meetings and beg for pay that isn’t atrocious. The county has been on National Television for cheating and falsely passing students to make it look as if they are doing something while only sitting on the board to fatten their pockets and gain influence with the Maryland political elite.

We have a bad housing problem. The housing problem can be blamed on Rental Companies. They have raised the average price of a home in the area to an extreme degree. They buy up homes when they go on sale for prices that completely outbid their actual worth. This has led to a situation in which most people are forced into renting or overpaying on real estate.

The police situation speaks for itself. Though the fact that the democrats decided to give them more money after 2020 to placate the white “moderates” is something that should never ever be ignored.

The need for a black nationalist party is great. The democrats have used us for free votes yet have given us nothing but empty promises. The White Liberal views us as pawns to use against their political enemies. The Black Nationalist Party should be able to fight for our community's benefit. We are 13% of the country. If we work together, we can take our political power and implement it on a national level so we can’t be ignored for years on end and only brought up during election season.

My ideas for policies to run on to help the black community.

* Government-funded Housing for the homeless.

6089,xtqraj,3rd Positionism and the Left. A warning from history.,"During Weimar Germany, the narrative typically discusses three factions vying for power:

The Communists, Social Democrats, and the Nazis. These are typically discussed as three solid groups, mutually exclusive, fighting each other to the death. But what if I told you there was a large section of individuals in this  vying for power, whose loyalties were not that strong? What if I told you there was a section of the working class that wanted revolution, wanted promises of an economy that would benefit them, but didn’t know much else? 

This section of the working class existed and it initially filled the ranks of all three sections in this fight. And it was in one faction of the Nazis, that this section of the working class would be drawn to. 

These were the Strasserites, followers of Gregor and Otto Strasser and their brand of Nazism known as [Strasserism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasserism?wprov=sfti1). This group is what dominated and filled the ranks of the infamous [Brownshirts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturmabteilung?wprov=sfti1). Their platform was straightforward: A Socialist Germany where power and wealth would be given to the people, if they would target the Jews and ally themselves with the reactionary right against “the elites”. 

And to this sect of the Nazis flocked entire divisions of the [Red Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roter_Frontk%C3%A4mpferbund?wprov=sfti1) as well as many Social Democrats. It was these betrayals of many who were formerly considered comrades that allowed the Brownshirts numbers to reach into the millions. These traitors were known as [beefsteak Nazis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beefsteak_Nazi?wprov=sfti1). And they played a key role in the weakening and dividing of the left at the explicit benefit of the right.

And to the main point of my post now. Comrades I want to know your opinions. I believe there is a growing brand of populism on the “left” that is preaching class reductionism. That is preaching that the current rise of fascism represents the rise of the true working class. That misdirects people to fight the establishment rather than a focussed attack on the bourgeoisie. That focusses attention on fighting liberalism, progressives, or “divisive marginalized groups” far more than it encourages the fighting of reactionaries. That actively promotes the agendas of reactionary world governments under the guise of anti-imperialism. “MAGA Communism” is just the most recent tip of this cancerous iceberg. It’s been growing for years and I feel we really need to take a harder look at what narratives we allow in our spaces. 

So many on the left right now are young and disenfranchised. New to and just learning what Socialism is, this new demographic is ripe for being lead astray. I fear fascists are among us comrades, and they may portray themselves as our Ally’s for now, but they are not. They may not even realize it themselves.

When someone makes a claim or states their stance on a piece of news or discussion point however, principled debate and discussion can often give way to bad faith attacks on people rather than arguments or claims. 

So I suggest as a starting point, should there be a requirement for sources or evidence be cited when a claim is made? Or are there other standards people believe should be moderated on the sub? 

I feel this community may be one of the first leftist communities new leftists may be a part of before moving onto other non-internet organizing spaces. The standards set here can likely ripple into other leftist organizing spaces. One subreddit where I think very informative discussions are held because of higher discussion standards is /r/neutralpolitics where rules such as citations for claims are required among other standards, and this does serve as a basis for this post.

Or do people think things should stay as they are or that increased moderation standards here may be infeasible?

Finally, while not personally a Maoist, some of the insights of Mao’s writing on the importance of principled and informed discussion in [Oppose Book Worship](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-6/mswv6_11.htm) are also inspirational",-7866967344716710827,0

It's just that I'm looking at this topic from a Muslim POV since I'm a Muslim myself**

I see this sentiment all the time, not only among Conservatives but also Liberals and sometimes even ""Progressives"".  They feel like they have to take it upon *themselves* to push for social change within Muslim communities **(with little to no input from Muslims themselves)**, both inside and outside their borders.

The greatest example of this imo is how a lot of Libs and SocDems justify opposing the US's recent Afghanistan pullout, and supporting the subsequent crippling sanctions on the country, by saying things like, *""We must protect the women of Afghanistan from the Taliban!""*.

Another example is how a lot of people support banning Hijabs in order to *""uphold Secularism""* and *""protect women from abuse""*, even though these measures accomplish nothing other than isolating and radicalizing Muslim communities even further.

All of this is extremely ironic given how Western Imperialism and Neo-Imperialism is a **huge** factor behind the social regression we see in Muslim countries. Not only has the West deprived Muslims from Centuries of social development through Colonialism and the propping up of Hardline Islamist regimes and groups, but have also tried actively imposing **(both directly and indirectly through dictators such as Iran's wholesome 100 big chungus Pahlavi Monarchy)** values such as Secularism and Womens' rights on Muslims, which has caused the latter to negatively see these values as a remnant of Colonialism. This collective sense of Trauma due to Colonial oppression, **not Islam itself**, is the main reason behind why so many Muslims loath Secularism and Womens'/LGBT rights.

Why not limit the amount one entity/corporation can hold? This eliminates the potential for greed, destroys the ability for inflation to exist, and destroys the income gap and income inequality that exists in this society. 

The only argument I’ve seen against this so far is “but then nobody would have motivation to create new technology”. Well if people need money to be motivated to create, then those people should not exist in society. What ever happened to doing things for the sake of doing things? What ever happened to random acts of kindness for the betterment of society without recognition? The principles we were raised upon as children is not followed by our world leaders. It’s a joke. What if we just made a society where being productive was the standard, but being equal was also the standard? What if certain people who were the greatest innovators held more wealth, but not at the expense of those who weren’t innovative? Why do some people even need billions of dollars? They don’t. The only reason inflation exists is because if people have more money, then we can raise our prices, right? What if there was no motivation to raise prices because of a market cap?

# In this week's episode we discuss abortion rights in West Germany, and how US subversion of the German Social Democratic Party, and the support for chancellor Konrad Adenauer of the Christian Democratic Union cemented right-wing abortion policy in West Germany for decades. 

While not perfect by any stretch, the East German abortion laws were reformed in the 1970s, showing -- if not a complete respect for women as equal political and economic figures -- a responsiveness to political and social pressures in a way the capitalist west never saw.

6110,xt596s,Fear of Dying,"I am an American. I am 19 years old. I am extremely afraid of dying. I have been afraid of dying for as long as I can remember being alive, with only brief intermissions where I have felt neutral towards death. Despite this being one of, if not, the most dangerous of the developed countries on this planet, I haven't very often felt intense fear over the idea of getting COVID or getting shot or getting stabbed or getting into a car accident, even if I sometimes worry about it. I am mostly afraid of becoming old and dying of natural causes. It feels more existential and inescapable than dangerous. I have mostly viewed this as a problem of me worrying too much about certain things, but I feel like I'm beginning to understand.

&#x200B;

I think a majority component of this fear is rooted partly in capitalism, but mostly in American society as a whole. American society as a whole, doesn't possess many values, or at least many values that are worth preserving.

* US society does not value life, justice or nature. We exploit the environment as much as possible. We stole the environment in the first place largely from the Indigenous peoples. The United States is largely responsible for global warming, which threatens life on planet Earth. Cops and citizens are regularly maiming and killing minorities, and many people flock to defend them because they think violence is basically justified when used against people who are different than them. Constant mass shootings. We've backed, created and funded countless vicious dictatorships around the globe. We're regularly at war.
* US society does not value education or science. America generally underfunds education and scientific endeavors. Scientists, academics, and educators often find themselves in a poor life-work balance when they can find work, sometimes being paid a pittance, and maybe doing work that appeases corporations. Intellectuals and experts are openly despised and not trusted by perhaps not most, but a significant amount of this country; as anti-intellectualism and intellectual-cowardice runs rampant and only like quantum physicists are trusted.
* US society does not value equality. Capitalism, which is baked into American society, seems to require hierarchy. It is highly apparent that straight, wealthy White males, and White people in general, are at the top of American society \[the American hierarchy\], and are valued as such. Minorities still regularly face discrimination and contempt in every facet of society, though it has generally become more subtle than was in the past, due to progress. Though, this gives White supremacists and conservative-types enough plausible deniability that they can pretend that minorities are barely, if at all, facing any discrimination, and promote the idea that Whites are being persecuted and need to take their power back. NIMBYism is a constant in this country, and people have proven eager to kick the ladder behind them or even prevent another ladder from reaching them.
* US society does not value art. Our films are becoming increasingly made for profit. Art is underfunded, making it extremely competitive to get into. People also seem to be increasingly working more hours for less financial security, making even pursuing hobbies, like art, more difficult. People who choose to study art in any form in higher-education are made fun of because they have trouble finding work and weren't more practical with what they chose to study. Art is often criticized for essentially not being commercial and conventional enough. Social safety nets, which could benefit non-professional/indie artists (alongside most people in general) and give them enough security to regularly produce art, aren't really a thing in this country.
* US society does not value comfort, community, or family values. We push this idea of ""hard work"", probably evolved from the Protestant work ethic, and it seems that very often throughout my entire life that anyone who just relaxes and goes at their own pace is described as lazy or unproductive, and might be bothered. Public school feels like it was designed to be as uncomfortable as humanly possible, with a cast of authority figures constantly speaking down to you but expecting you to handle all the regulations and piles of busywork they give you. It is still popular for people to stick to the ""9/5"" where they have to wake up early 5 days a week and spend much of their day at work, despite this model being outdated and not necessarily even efficient. This causes many workers to kind of miss being with their families and sometimes communities. Communities are also broken up, through the nuclear family structure, car-centric infrastructure, hyper-individualism and the semi-justified American distrust of strangers. Though, there are even worse factors in some communities, like African-Americans with police violence.
* Overall, American society as a whole (and many individual Americans, consciously or not) only appears to value the people at the top echelons of society becoming increasingly and increasingly powerful, as they ruin the rest of the human world and fuck up the planet. The United States of America, at least as it currently is and has been, is a giant nihilistic corporate death cult of White supremacy.

The point of this, is that I feel that if there wasn't any of the aforementioned major problems with American society, I don't think I would be especially afraid of dying. I think if we had a more humanistic, socialistic, and progressive system, most/all of these issues could wade away or be solved in time, as well as the issues America directly or indirectly causes across the globe. I think life would be fulfilling enough that death would seem too distant for it to matter, to me at least.",-3349134027754081750,0

Many Americans are feeling pain at the pump, gas goes up and news reports on it but all major publications and local news aren't providing a critical analyses nor an explanation as why this is. There is no public pressure to demand answers from Oil executives. California is about to give relief checks for Gas and it seems the Oil companies are taking advantage. Every time liberals do something like this results dire consequences because they are not attacking the root of the problem.

Ethically & morally I believe Oil companies should not be a private venture and they should be a shared resource since it does come from the planet and we must re-invest the profits into renewable, alternative, sustainable energy instead of the yachts and coke parties of these Oil Tycoons.

That said, what can we actually do from outside Iran to support the protests? Not much, really, but we can be cautious about one thing: Western intervention. The US and its allies are evidently not popular in Iran, so a movement seen as backed by Western states would likely lose popular support. Yet we can be sure that if these protests continue, Western states will try to use them to their advantage, by supporting certain US-allied groups with ties to Iran or through additional sanctions. This is essentially the main thing we have to oppose as socialists, because if the West manages to instrumentalize this movement, it is unlikely to succeed, and if it does the result will not be a very good one. It has a much better chance if simply observed and supported from afar, rather than being backed by state actors pursuing their own interests. So if you want the protests to really succeed, be wary of Western intervention.

Edit: I should add one more thing. Western states continue to deport people back to Iran, and this can and should also be protested. Deportation must never be tolerated.",335005152905684686,0

6171,xqq8j8,my thought at Iranian protest as an Iranian.,"I've seen many many different responses from leftist to these protest and I would like to explain my position as well.



We are in a historic era, even western geopoliticalist know that the shift from a unipolar world to a multipolar is happening, this shift would make the world unstable for at least a decade, protests would form in everywhere and in every block, these are natural in the next 10 years.


I'm against Mandatory hijab, but one thing is certain, the rule was supported by a majority until at least 10 years ago, for the majority of its existence it was supported by most people. The protest started with accusations that she was beaten to death, the government showed a video of her collapsing due to stress and not getting beaten( she was walking perfectly and unless you want to dismiss the video as fake you can't say she was beaten with no proof other than a tweet.) but by then it was already late.


USA invovlment in these protest is adding fuel to a fire, but they weren't the one lighting the match, this was absolutely IRI fault.


Every protest in Iran gets hijacked by various groups and a simple non violent protest with a specific means to it gets hijacked by separatists and overthrowners (that's the name of people that want the Islamic Republic gone at any cost, usually monarchies and liberals).


IRI absolutely loves this because it allows them to convince their supporters that these protests are invalid and illegitimate. USA loves this too because it can put a propaganda campaign on how Iranian wants a revolution. 

There are both rioters and actual protesters in these protests.



Lots of fake news about the army joining people, cities falling to protesters and high command leaving Iran were coming out and all of these usually comes out from Western sources to give some people hope that a revolution is happening everywhere and they should come out if they want to be a part of it, of course this isn't a revolution but western media loves too make this way bigger than it actually is and make it as long as possible. 


A faction of Iranian protesters called reformist which are usually liberals and want social change too were always happy to join the USA world order and wanted it so bad they helped America in its adventure in Afghanistan and Iraq and everytime they got cucked by America, 1992, 2002, and 2015 with JCPOA, everytime USA has made them look like clowns because it constantly betray them, USA is partly responsible for Iran hardline conservatives becoming the dominant faction, because ironically they have a better understanding about imprelism than these liberals. 




The crocodile tear the western crowd is shedding is nothing but disrespectful to Iranians, Sanctions have made our life so much worse than these rules which were popular in a different time and climate and now they aren't. I can tell you that 99% of these protesters anger was charging because of economic problems and not social ones, the stress we put on when we are seeing higher and higher prices is nothing compared to the stress a woman gets when a morality police is around, which are now almost extinct but the government keeps a few thousands around just to keep its supporters happy, they are way less common to find than 10 years ago.




If you are a western leftist just know that while the government has its long listed of issues, it is much more better than a western backed monarch and that is the best scenario, in the worse scenario we would become another Syria or Libya if USA interferes with the protest due to having high support from its people because of these recent propaganda campaign. 



Sanctions and embargos damages to the country are nothing like our internal issues, when a country losses its half of revenue it will be more and more unstable, the worst is over for us, The situation will get better in the next couple of years because frankly there is no other Sanctions they could inforce.",-2230710649173210565,0

What do banks fear?  Long lines!  It usually signals financial instability.  This drives more people to line up if they think their deposited money is in danger (FDIC insures their deposit, but not everyone knows this), which can lead to a bank run, which can shut backs down.  Banks have invested money into research to keep lines short.

To hit them where it hurts, protestors can form long lines into the banks.  For it to be effective, people can't acknowledge it's a protest until after it's over.  In the meantime, everyone acts like a normal potential customer, asking about loans or deposits and other such services and products.  This also makes it harder for banks to distinguish between protestors and legitimate customers.

I was just in a political science course at Arizona State University in the United States of America when we were speaking about how General Motors, an American company, was bailed out by the United States government at 30%. My teacher tried to argue that this was Socialism and inference how it was dangerous because the state could take control. I am mediately spoke up and explain to her that this is state sponsored capitalism, that the workers in the factory had no say, that a Board of Directors took bail out money for the mistakes they made and then were transferred back wealth.

She tried to argue that the government got to tell them what to do as far as getting into the new market for electric vehicles and that was a form of Socialism. This is a paradox because number one, anything governments do cannot just be labeled as a socialistic concept. Socialism is a means of production Seizure in full. The government can mandate moving in the right direction because “the free market“ cannot, but this does not make it socialist. All I had to do was keep going back to the workers never got to say a board of directors did.

I'm looking for materials such as articles, books or research papers that look into if profit made on the housing market and home equity loans increase inflation. Do any of you know of such materials?

The reason why I'm looking for such materials:

The common knowledge is if a central bank prints more money, it can cause inflation because if you just increase the money supply without expanding the real economy with more workers, factories, natural resources or more productive technology, you don't make a ""larger or better cake"" the increased money supply essentially just divides ""the cake"" into smaller pieces.

... but how about ""new money"" coming from home equity loans and house sale profits? Unless you built the house yourself, you haven't improved the real economy. The house, to a large extent, just printed you some money that you can spend on whatever you want to.

Hope you get my point!",-8776745590631611461,0

about the protests

ده روز است که بسیاری از شهرهای ایران به صحنه ی رودرروئی، اعتراض و فریاد مردم تحت ستم ایران بدل گشته است. قتل ژینا امینی که احساسات همه مردم ایران را جریحه دار کرد جرقه ای بود که خشم و اعتراض فرو خفته توده های مردم علیه ستمهای انباشته ی این چهل و سه ساله که جمهوری اسلامی به مردم ایران و مشخصا زنان اعمال کرده را فروزان کرد. ستمهای انباشته ای که ستم بر زنان یکی از مهمترین این ستم ها است. ستمی که پتانسیل عظیمی در مبارزه برای سرنگونی جمهوری اسلامی در خود نهفته دارد. چرا که لغو حجاب به مثابه نماد اسلام سیاسی نه تنها در ایران بلکه در منطقه، به زیر کشیدن قدرت اسلام سیاسی را هدف گرفته است. جنبش اسلام سیاسی که نه تنها برای حاکمیت سرمایه داران در ایران، بلکه برای همدستان این رژیم جنایتکار یعنی شرکای امپریالیست از ابتدای به سرکار آمدنش و تا همین الان هم، کارکردی حیاتی دارد. روشن است آن سیستمی که ستم برزنان را نه تنها در ایران بلکه در سراسر جهان تولید و بازتولید می کند، سیستمی است که در آن روابط کالایی سرمایه دارانه حاکم است. اما دولت های امپریالیستی بیش از چند دهه است با حمایت و یا روی کار آوردن حکومت های اسلامی در برخی از کشورها مانند ایران توانسته اند جنبش اجتماعی و مترقی را نه تنها در یک کشور بلکه در منطقه مورد تعرض قرار دهند. البته این تعرض پی در پی به حقوق زنان اگرچه هیچگاه از جانب انسانهای آزاده و زنان بی جواب نمانده است، اما بهرحال حاکمیت سرمایه داران اسلامی چهار دهه است که در قدرت هستند و برای ماندن در قدرت از هیچ جنایتی فروگذار نکرده اند.

این روزها به گلوله بستن زنان و جوانان در کف خیابان، نشان می دهد که حاکمیت در ایران هم می داند به زیر کشیدن و آتش زدن روسری یک تعرض قدرتمند سیاسی ایدئولوژیک به یکی از پایه های حاکمیت جمهوری اسلامی است. سران رژیم می دانند که این تعرض ایدئولوژیک، مبارزه برای سرنگونی انقلابی جمهوری اسلامی را وارد فصل تازه ای می کند.

طرح اینترنت ماهواره ای که گویا ایلان ماسک میلیاردر آمریکایی با هماهنگی وزارت خزانه داری آمریکا در اختیار مردم ایران قرار داده است، نشان می دهد که خطر سرنگونی رژیم هم برای امپریالیستهایی که منافع مشترک دارند هشدار دهنده است، و تلاش آنها این است تا آنجا که ممکن است خود را حامی این خیزش جلوه دهند و در بزنگاه مشخص برای آلترناتیوی که منافعشان را تامین می کند وارد عمل شوند. البته آلترناتیو سازی امپریالیستها امر تازه ای نیست هم اکنون هم رضا پهلوی، شورای مدیریت گذار و بخش های مختلف اپوزیسیون بورژوایی هم دندان تیز کرده اند که به هرشکلی که می توانند سهمی در آینده ایران داشته باشند. از این رو برای مردم تحت ستم ایران، کارگران و زحمتکشان، به حاشیه رانده شدگان و مخصوصا زنان تصویری روشن از آلترناتیو حکومتی برای آینده ی ایران به همان اندازه ی خیزشی که اکنون جانانه و با شجاعت به پیش می برند، ضروری و حیاتی است. قیام 57 و از کف رفتن این فرصت تاریخی برای مردم ایران، نشان داد که آمادگی برای کسب قدرت سیاسی تا چه اندازه اهمیت دارد. این آمادگی در تمام عرصه ها باید به شکلی سازمان داده شود که زنان، کارگران و زحمتکشان و تهیدستان شهری، اقلیتهای تحت ستم جوانان، بیکاران و….مطمئن شوند در هر شرایطی منافع آنها تأمین می گردد و از طریق شوراها و دیگر نهادهای حاکمیت توده ای قدرت واقعی را در اختیار خواهند داشت.

بدون تردید توده ای شدن حضور مردم در کف خیابان  می تواند جامعه ی جهانی را تحت تاثیر قرار داده و باردیگر انسانهای مترقی و آزادیخواه را در کشورهای مختلف در همبستگی به خود به خیابان بکشاند و پایه های جمهوری اسلامی را بلرزاند. برای پیشروی این خیزش سراسری لازم است افق انقلابی و روشنی پیش روی آن قرار گیرد. اگر به زمین افکندن و سوزاندن روسری ها اسلام سیاسی یعنی یکی از پایه های ایدئولوژیک حاکمیت جمهوری اسلامی را مورد تعرض قرار می دهد، اما نباید از این غافل باشیم که پایه اصلی حاکمیت جمهوری اسلامی نظام طبقاتی سرمایه داری است. رژیم جمهوری اسلامی با تکیه بر این نظام طبقاتی است که ستمکشی بر زنان و کارگران و ستمدیدگان را تولید و بازتولید می کند. بنابراین گستراندن افق رهائی بخش سوسیالیستی از پیش شرط های پیشروی  خیزش سراسری جاری است. از دیگر پیش شرط های پیشروی خیزش مهسا هر چه توده ای تر شدن و سراسری تر شدن و به میدان آمدن طبقه کارگر در ابعاد اجتماعی است. با هر چه توده ای تر شدن این خیزش و به میدان آمدن طبقه کارگر با اعتصابات سراسری است که نیروهای سرکوبگر دشمن فلج و زمینگیر می شوند.

با گستراندن افق روشن سوسیالیستی است که آن دسته از بدیل ها که می خواهند یک رژیم دمکراتیک اسلامی، یا مشروطه سلطنتی یا یک استبداد سرمایه داری غیر مذهبی لائیک جایگزین رژیم جمهوری اسلامی کنند به حاشیه رانده می شوند. آن دسته از  آلترناتیوهایی که فقط  مذهبی بودن حکومت فعلی را به چالش می کشند و صرفا با سیستم های لائیک تأکید می کنند مانع پیشروی جنبش آزادیخواهانه در ایران می شوند. بنابراین شعارهایی مانند “مرگ بر دیکتاتور”، “مرگ بر ستمگر چه شاه باشه چه رهبر” ، “نان کار آزادی” در ادامه لازم است خود را در ارائه بدیلی که رهائی از هر نوع مناسباتی که دیکتاتوری را باز تولید می کند، رهائی از هر نوع مناسباتی که نان و کار و آزادی انسانها را به گرو می گیرد و تحقق واقعی آزادی را تضمین کند، نشان دهد. چنین بدیلی نمی تواند چیزی جز بدیل سوسیالیستی باشد.

آلترناتیو سوسیالیستی در مسیر پیشروی خود در جریان مبارزه، شوراها ارگان حاکمیت کارگران و زحمتکشان و مدیریت جامعه را شکل می دهد، در گام نخست رژیم جمهوری اسلامی را سرنگون می کند. ماشین دولتی موجود را همراه با کلیه ی ارگانهای سرکوب آن درهم می شکند و حکومت شوراها را برقرار می سازد. حکومت شورائی وسیع ترین آزادی های بدون قید و شرط سیاسی را تأمین و تضمین می نماید. با اجتماعی کردن مالکیت بر وسائل تولید، همه ظرفیتهای اقتصادی و اجتماعی موجود در جامعه ایران را با برنامه و نقشه مند، به کار می گیرد. رفع نیازهای مردم، تأمین زندگی مرفه و شایسته انسان به هدف تولید تبدیل می شود. بدین ترتیب شکوفائی و توسعه اقتصادی واقعی ممکن می گردد ، بازده كار با سرعتى غیر قابل تصور افزایش خواهد یافت، خدمات و محصولات مورد نیاز مردم در مقیاس انبوه برای رفع نیازهای مادی و معنوی انسانها تولیدمی شوند. مردم از امکانات یکسان و فراوان برای رشد استعداد و توانائی های فردی برخوردار خواهند بود و توانائی های فردی شکوفا میشوند.

در نظام اجتماعی سوسیالیستی پیشرفت های علمی و تکنولوژیک امکان پایین آوردن ساعات کار و افزایش ساعات فراغت را فراهم می آورد. جامعه سوسیالیستی نابرابریها و تبعیض ها یی نظیر ستمکشی زن و ستمگری ملی و مذهبی را ریشه کن می شوند. تبعیض جنسیتی و تنگ نظری ملی و نژادی جای خود را به همبستگی انسانی خواهد داد. سوسیالیسم به تخریب و فجایع زیست محیطی که هستی، امنیت و رفاه انسان ها را به مخاطره انداخته اند پایان می دهد و حفاظت و بهره برداری عقلانی از طبیعت را به معیار اصلی پیشرفت و توسعه خود تبدیل می کند. تحقق چنین جامعه ای، خیال پردازی و تصور مدینه فاضله آرمانی نیست. حرکتی در سیر تحول مادی تاریخ بشر است. نیروی اجتماعی آن در قامت اعتراضات و اعتصابات باشکوه کارگران، اعتراضات و خیزش های تهیدستان شهری و زنان آزاده در صحنه حضور دارد و امکانات مادی تحقق آن وجود دارد. اما برای ارتقای سازمانیابی این نیروی اجتماعی، برای برپایی یک جنبش شورایی و برای برقراری سوسیالیسم باید آستین ها را بالا زد.

A whisper goes through the world  
Workers, don't you hear it?  
These are the voices of the Ministers of War  
Workers, don't you hear them?  


Coal and steel producers whisper  
It whispers chemical war production  
It whispers from all continents  
Mobilization against the Soviet Union  


Workers, peasants, take the guns  
Pick up the guns  
Smash the fascist armies of robbers  
Sets fire to all hearts  


Plant your red flags of victory  
On every hill, on every factory  
Then lies out of the ashes of the last warrior  
The World Socialist Republic  
Then rises from the ashes of the last warrior  
The World Socialist Republic  


Workers listen, they go into the field  
And scream for nation and race  
This is the war of the rulers of the world  
Against the working class  
Because the attack against the Soviet Union  
Is the thrust into the heart of the revolution  
And the war that is now just around the corner  
Is the war against you, Prolet  


Workers, peasants, take the guns  
Pick up the guns  
Smash the fascist armies of robbers  
Sets all hearts on fire  


Plant your red flags of victory  
On every hill, on every factory  
Then blooms from the ashes of the last war

The title of the post isn't very good but I wanted to ask this question or get the perspective of other like minded individuals as I imagine a lot of you have had similar situations.

Recently, I have been talking to my family members or friends who are pre-dominantly right-leaning just because they have been indoctrinated and brainwashed by the propaganda of the right. A couple of examples include me explaining social safety nets and how we could improve the standards of life of almost everybody by implementing different systems but I do all of this without mentioning the name ""socialism"". I've also made them change their mind about who they should be getting angry at because most of them seem to think they should be blaming the little guys that are receiving help from the system and that they are ""free-loaders"" and need to get jobs and work for a living. And for the most part this method of explaining how socialism is more likely to help them, rather than hurt them without saying ""socialism"" is pretty effective.

But the problem I have run into is a particular sort of individual that doesn't even want to help themselves and want worship the billionaire overlords as demi-gods. Thinking that we should be licking the bottom of their feet.

For example, My old coworker at a pizza shop making 12$ an hour who is fatigued and tired of life seemed to think I was a centrists and so he would bring up conservative talking points around me. I basically dis-regarded his propaganda and kept spouting we need to tax the rich. And let me tell you, this one phrase made him BLOW UP in my face. He went on and on about the rich deserve their wealth and the fact they take advantage of the tax loopholes is just them being ""smart"" and knowing how to become richer while us peasants should follow their lead. I asked him if he thought Mark Zuckerberg worked 1 million times harder than the average American and he replied

""Yes! He made a product and is a job creator and is taking all the risk by starting the company so he is absolutely entitled to all the money he gets.""

6276,xlxtnh,Hypothetical contingency plan for capitalism market.,"Hi guys my first time posting here. As a geographer from Latin America who studies environmental science I have a view over how natural resources and environmental protection could be used in order to make capitalism obsolete (or incapable of continuing as a system).

Of course is an hypothetical idea and may have many gaps or points that I'm not considering but I would like your comments on this.

So basically I see capitalism system as a type (or extension?) of a living organism, and as a living organism (or system) seems to follow a certain pattern. There is an input of energy (commodities) and an output (waste). My thoughts on this is that capitalism thrives as long as there is a continuous flow of input (imperialism appropriation of developing countries) or as long it has a continuous flow of output (garbage, wasted, pollution mainly shipped as second hand products or as garbage to other countries)

The input part is really hard to stop, there is a well developed base and structure. Now, the output on the other hand, seems to be easier to attack. Basically making all the waste products been kept in the same system.

For example: Spain produces a lot o garbage from the quick fashion industry. And a lot of clothes that didn't sell they are shipped to Latin America that later on is processed and many end up in landfill in Atacama desert... So making the these clothes that didn't sell and all the garbage inside Spain would make the system either collapse or change due to the size of the country and the quantity of waste.

This is a summary of my thoughts and it's very rudimentary of course. I would like to know you opinion on this.

Thanks a lot for reading!

People used to be able to pick a place they wanted to live, erect a little cabin, and become part of a social structure. Other people around them erected their house from raw materials, people did the minimum with whatever materials they had because that was all they needed to do legally to survive. Then, they became part of the community and had enough respect to enter society.

Now to own property that enables survival takes a lifetime of work to only have the mere possiblity, over the course of 15 years or more, to work towards owning.

UK based - I'm fully aware of how the nature of landlordin is exploitative and extractive, and am currently tryin to talk my parents into doing something along the lines of a rent-to-buy scheme with their current tenants. Me dad is onboard me mam is less so, so I'm tryna gather info nd streamline the process but have hit a proper wall with it.

They have a single property that they inherited a few years ago with long term tenants (2/3 years every payment on-time ect). From their perspective they're 'good landlords' as they've never raised the rent even when the agency they use have pressured them to. However its *obviously* preferred that they exit the landlord arrangement all together.

I've looked at various options including selling the apartment (would require kicking out the current tenants who can't afford to buy outright or mortgage) or giving the apartment to the tenants (i think would require us to go via inherentence laws? and is unlikely to be something my parents will ever agree to) so rent-to-own/rent-to-buy is looking like the mostly likely option. I'm sorta unsure as to how to go about doing that? Researching it, it seems like it's mostly done through housing associations but I cannae find anything from the perspective of owners rather than buyers (other than landlords saying it's a bad idea because you lose the property).

Has anyone else done this or know anyone who's done this? Has anyone been a buyer in this sorta situation? Is this a viable option? Anyone got resources for how to stop being a landlord or how to persuade folks out of landlordin.I know there is a lot of talk about the horrors of landlordin but I'm weirdly struggling to find stuff on how to *stop* being a landlord. I'm based in the UK so answers from UK (specifically England ik it's different in wales Scotland and North of Ireland) perspectives would be best.

6340,xk3pv1,50 years since the declaration of Martial Law in the Philippines,"September 21, 1972, as the Filipino masses were doing their usual errands in the late afternoon prime, the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr. (The father of Philippine elected president Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.) declared the implementation of Martial Law in the Philippines, following the resurgence of communist guerrilla army the New People’s Army (Bagong Hukbong Bayan in Tagalog) lead by Communist Party of the Philippines Chairperson Jose Maria “Joma” Sison. We, the Filipino people, will always remember the implementation of Martial Law in a negative, and inhumane way as numerous extrajudicial killings and abductions (the desaparecidos) occurred day and night against farmers, unionists, activists, and ordinary people. Buti we also remember the rise of the red revolution in the countryside to contradict and battle the rising US Imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and feudalism.

We were reminded in our history at what causes the rise of communism in the Philippines is due to the neoliberal policies that dictator Marcos Sr. implemented against the interest of the masses which lead to the increasing rate of poverty and famine. He was never an pro-mass leader, but pro-capitalist that feed the rich, his cronies, with wealth and power. We will never forget the massacres done by his armed forces against the masses to protect the wealth of his cronies and his own. Yesterday, we commemorated the anniversary of Escalante Massacre where 20 were killed while being water-bombed by the paramilitary during the protest of the mangtutubo (sugarcane farmers). The implementation of martial law was never to protect the people against the rebellion, but to protect his power and agendas with the US.

Today marks the 50th anniversary of the declaration of martial law. This year, 2022, another Marcos, partnered by two oligarchs who have sinned against the Filipino people, the Dutertes and the Arroyos, are joint forcing to exploit the rich natural resources and human resources of the Philippines for their own interests and to serve two imperialist countries—the US and China. Now, as they are in power, they are now distorting the dark history of Martial Law with unrealistic “fairytales” that the masses would easily believe. We all know the Philippines is one of the most uneducated people in the world, and they are now on the move to exploit their struggles in exchange of power. I remember what Karl Marx have said about the repetition of history: “History repeats its self, first as a tragedy, second as a farce.” Our status in the Philippines is the embodiment of Marx’ quote.

But now that most Filipino people (especially those who have access to quality education) are well educated with the Philippine history, we must now polish our knowledge into the Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, to contradict capitalism and once again rise the revolution as to what our ancestors did from the Katipunan, to the National Democratic Movement. We must embrace the struggle not to be weak, but to be stronger and agitated. We must unite and organize the youth, workers, farmers, women, indigenous people, and the church people to fight the imperialism of US and China, the state fascism of the armed forces, and the joint forces of the Marcos-Arroyo-Duterte tandem. If our people have ousted two presidents before, why not make it three?

I have a question, and would love to hear some socialist perspectives on it.

Sorry if this is a basic or flawed premise, but I'm trying my best :) Also this is not something that I'm trying to figure out for my own work situation (I work for myself independently as a freelancer), just something I'd like to understand better generally.

Let's say a person (""founder"") develops a teaching method of some kind. (I'm in the U.S., so I'm imagining this as taking place here, in our current society.)

They spend - I don't know - 2 years developing this method, part-time. They want as many people as possible to be taught, using this method, so they train others (""workers"") to teach with it (let's say it takes 2 months to train each worker). Clients pay to be taught, using this method. 

What would be the most ethical way to distribute fees from the clients. I understand that in our capitalist society, the founder would try to extract as much profit from their employees as possible. 

Would the more ethical solution be to form a collective that would democratically decide what amount of money would go to the founder for their time developing the method and training others? Are there other systems or alternatives to justly distribute the fees?",8071025964955563358,0

Welcome to your weekly Sunday social. This was the result of a great suggestion by one of the community. So if anyone has any suggestions then feel free to send them to us, and successful ones will have a reward with some reddit gold!

The idea behind this is to give LabourUK members a weekly thread that lets everyone have a rest from politics. This will hopefully allow everyone to get to know each other outside of our political views and discuss anything non-political. You never know, you may actually have similar interests! So to keep in the spirit of our authoritarianism, there are a few things first:

1. The subject matter is to try and stay away from politics please

2. Feel free to ask anything

3. New members are more than welcome to contribute, and this may be a chance to introduce yourself to the sub!

4. The normal sub rules will apply to this thread 

So feel free to post whatever you want to moan/chat/raise, talk about your hobbies or anything you like (following rule 1 of course)!",5169122778838942306,0

- a points based immigration system described in farage like terms
- the tax payer can’t afford to keep putting money into the NHS forever
- longer sentences for climate protectors than even tories want under the draconian police and crime bill
- ID cards explicitly promoted to curb illegal immigration and stir up racists sentiment 
-refused to back nurses strike or even state that pay should be kept up with inflation to avoid a real times wage cut

**It's a shortened parliamentary week.**

MPs head back to their constituencies on Wednesday evening for a mini recess. It's not a long one - they'll be back next Monday.

**The agenda is looking pretty safe before then.**

Absent is anything controversial like the Online Safety Bill.

Instead, we've got a couple of ten minute rule motions and social housing reforms in response to the Grenfell Tower tragedy which reaches the Commons after going through its Lords stages. (Typically, government bills that start in the Lords are the less contentious ones.)

**And Labour has an opposition day debate on Tuesday.**

This is where they get to set the agenda. Still TBC what they want to discuss, but it's likely either to be a current issue they want to bash the government on, or something more thematic like the cost of living.

### MONDAY 7 NOVEMBER

**Social Housing (Regulation) Bill - 2nd reading**  
*Applies to: England, Wales, Scotland (part), Northern Ireland (Part)*  
Reforms social housing regulation following the Grenfell Tower tragedy. Changes include ""Ofsted-style"" inspections for underperforming landlords, requiring social housing landlords to test electrical installations, and introducing a Freedom of Information-style process for tenants to request information from landlords. Started in the Lords. More information [here](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/insight/insight/social-housing-regulation-bill-10-key-changes-for-the-sector-76102).

### TUESDAY 8 NOVEMBER

**Employee Share Ownership (Reform) Bill**  
Introduces a new employee share ownership scheme with preferential access for lower income workers. Ten minute rule motion presented by George Howarth.

### WEDNESDAY 9 NOVEMBER

**Sale of Tobacco (Licensing) Bill**  
Raises the age of sale for tobacco from 18 to 21. Ten minute rule motion presented by Bob Blackman.

### THURSDAY 10 NOVEMBER

[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-63526167](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-63526167)

It's like he's half-way towards a decent point, that the way you fix NHS staffing is by expanding training in the NHS (though how we do that while we allow the private sector to poach the expensive staff we train, as Streeting's repeatedly pledged, is beyond me).

The problem is that immigration is irrelevant to this: fixing the NHS is a question of both/and, not either/or.

And I realise that there will be some telling us that this is 11D chess involving showing that Labour is somehow ""strong"" on immigration but there are strong arguments that the long term effect of this centrist triangulation are largely negative: Blair's approach here for example led to a provable long-term decline in Labour's vote, it's deeply debateable that it had any effect on the Tory vote, which almost certainly just joined parties like UKIP instead of Labour and [evidence globally is that it leads to a resurgent far right](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2019/09/16/the-brahmin-left-vs-the-merchant-right-a-comment-on-thomas-pikettys-new-book/).

So really all he's done here is promise to undermine the health service by unnecessarily limiting its staffing while putting all the emphasis on the myth that ""concerns about immigration"" are at all respectable.",4931692562839931325,0

""Mr. Dean complains that Gödel ""cannot tell us what makes a mathematical statement true"", but Gödel's Incompleteness theorems make no attempt to do this""

Godels 1st theorem

“....., there is an arithmetical statement that is true,[1] but not provable in the theory (Kleene 1967, p. 250

Godel cant tell us what makes a mathematical statement true,

thus his theorem is meaningless

in the statement

godel cant tell us what the word ""true"" means

thus

the word ""true"" is meaningless

thus

the statement

""there is an arithmetical statement that is true,[1] but not provable in the theory""

is meaningless

thus

thus godels 1st theorem is meaningless

checkmate game over

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth#Mathematics

Gödel thought that the ability to perceive the truth of a mathematical or logical proposition is a matter of intuition, an ability he admitted could be ultimately beyond the scope of a formal theory of logic or mathematics[63][64] and perhaps best considered in the realm of human comprehension and communication, but commented: Ravitch, Harold (1998). ""On Gödel's Philosophy of Mathematics"".,Solomon, Martin (1998). ""On Kurt Gödel's Philosophy of Mathematics""

thus by not telling us what makes a maths statement true Godels 1st theorem is meaningless

Seems to me like a reminder for voters in England to stop voting Tory, and equally, demand Labour support proportional representation.

[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bs1K5rqbNY) his full speech from the ""SME4Labour"" gala.

Catch the bit from 2:15 - 3:05.

>""We had to make our Labour party fit to serve our country. And a huge part of that, a huge part of that right up there, with everything we've done for NATO and national security, is **showing to the British people that this party wants businesses to PROSPER. That we respect the contribution that profit makes, to jobs, to growth, and the taxes which pay for our Public Services.** 

>**We understand that we can only build a fairer, greener Britain by backing the Enterprises that you have built to the hilt.** ""That's why I feel so proud when I see rooms like this, because it shows that we've changed the party.""

And that's just the beginning. He says a lot more after that about his plans for Labour's relationship with business. 

At 3:53

>**Because if we cant to drive our country forward, we need a real partnership between state and market, business and unions. Town and City.** That's how we tackle the country's challenges. By pulling everyone in the same direction. Everyone contributing to a fairer, greener future.

He talked a lot about which areas a Labour government's gonna focus on(Entrepreneurs, green growth, skilling etc) but he didn't mention any new policies other than the ones Labour's already announced, like abolishing business rates. But still I got a lot more detail than I knew before.

----

I thought overall he hit it out of the park. If you're from the business community, an entrepreneur etc. or just work in the private sector you need to see this speech. He really gets what he needs to do for the economy. He's really accepted the role of Labour as a friend and partner of business. :D",-3879953841586089705,0

But I guess that is where all the likes of the BNP vote went 🤷 Probably not long before the Tories roll out some ""Putting British\* people first"" slogan.

Generally it seems Sunak was less up for it today than last week.

This line they're taking on immigration is the same as they are taking for the NHS and the economy. They keep talking about these things being in crisis as if they've not been in charge for 12 years!

So here are a few key quotes, don't moan about context because as I said the mods have  banned sharing the only website hosting the email and there is no easy way to copy it. To view the full email google ""Secret document reveals Israel lobby’s dominance of Labour"" the article is by Winstanley who is a crank but if you scroll to the bottom you can read the pdf which is just a straight leak. Cliffnotes of the leaks related to the big debates in Labour on these topics - 

First notes of the meeting is to forgive Starmer shadcab member Steve Reed for calling a Jewish Tory donor a puppet master becase the BoD ""were confident that Steve was unaware he was Jewish and of the context of his remark"" and because of Reed showing he ""understands how Jews have felt about the Labour Party in recent years"" but ""there would always be suspicion of those who served on the front bench, but that Steve was an ally in the fight against anti-semitism"".  They also praise Labour Together for replacing the leftwing leadership with Starmer. Sir Trevor Chinn said that he has worked with Steve and that he was a friend of Jews and that would be not be possible if he was an anti-semite. All stuff that was mocked as irrelevant when raised about leftwingers in the past...

""Amanda Bowman \[Chair of the BoD ""Defence Division""\] remarked that it was pleasing to hear in confidence Steve's work in defeeating in anti-Semitism emerging from the left of the party"" lol.

Amanda thanked Steve and others for their work in ""promoting the IHRA definition of and BDS in local gov"" (presumably means against BDS).

""The attitude of the Labour grassroots to changes the party is to embark on is now a concern"". Fucking hell, first the politicans, now the grassroots. People have been generally supportive of all the sensible changes, so worrying to think what they might mean here.

Bowman brings up BDS. She ""understands"" Labour might hestiate to support Tories on anti-BDS legislation but she tells Labour the whips should at least not oppose Tory anti-BDS legislation. She says that ""there is a long way for Labour to go to build trust on this"" and ""community \[Jewish?\] support has been dwindling but don't need unnecessary own goals on Israel-Palestine"" could mean a couple of things but sems to be saying that opposing the Tories anti-BDS legislation will upst some members of the Jewish community. 

Strawman that being against anti-semitism means you can say whatever you want, call for people to follow the IHRA. Of course the IHRA allows for criticism of Israel, infact it evens allows for people to be nasty so long as it's not expressing anti-semitism and isn't acting in a way different to other countries. I.e. ""fuck Israel, fuck the Israeli government, they are to blame for this latest atrocity and I don't care about hearing anything else"" is unconstructive but is not IHRA breaking. 

Then there is an attempt to suggest economic action against Israel is breaking IHRA definition because ""any boycotts or sanctions have impact on Jews living in Israel"" which obviously is a misuse of the IHRA definition that would offend the people who drafted it I imagine!

Steve Reed boasts about opposing BDS in the past to get more brownie points. Then goes further in his belly crawling by saying ""Steve will necer accept attempt to exceptionalise and delegitimate Israel"" and about how he has visited Israel and understand their security requrements and so on. Weird how our Jewish leader went to Israel and didn't seem to take the lessons Reed did... Reed seems to then call for more councillors to be taken on trips to Israel so they can see things how he does. Reed then offers to argue against BDS/for legislating against it with the Whips and Leaders Office. Israel is not being singled out any more than apartheid South Africa was when it comes to grasrroots boycotts, or anymore than other human rights abusing countries with calls for government sanactions and bans on arms sales. 

Russel from JLC suggests Luke Akehurst would be a good poitn of contact. Although Russel also mentions abotu being careful to not encourage conflicts in Britain by being too partisan on this issue, finally some wise words in this whole document! Shame that the groups here aren't interested in that, clearly purusing a partisan, divisive, line.

Discussion of issues affecting Jewish safety in Britain, looks mainly reasonable. Is about actual tensions not ""Corbyn is a Nazis!!!"" Hodge like drivel.

6665,yjn1rk,Would the NHS be in a similar position today had Labour been in power since 2010,"I work in the NHS.

I hear a lot of talk from my colleagues as well as the public as to how the Tories have deliberately underfunded the NHS in order to expand privatisation and eventually get rid of healthcare that is free at the point of delivery.

Wait times in the NHS from primary care to secondary cafe are currently abysmal for anything that is not a 2 week wait. I myself have experienced ordering urgent scans for patients to be done within the next 4 weeks only to be told that the wait is 3 months minimum (this was last year). Now I’m told by colleague such a scan would take a year. Patients are waiting hours (10+) to be seen in A&E. 2 ww targets for cancer are being missed.

I wasn’t working in the noughties but I am told that the NHS ran much better then, staff were well paid with higher morale and so retention was better, wait times were lower etc but since austerity everything has gone down hill.

Now I have never voted conservative, and I am not a labour voter either. I am not a die hard NHS fan but neither am I completely against it. I just want a health service that works.

I am aware there are some in Tory circles who would like to be rid of the NHS. But I struggle to believe that the current state of the NHS is due to deliberate underfunding because why would anyone do that surely? I know COVID has exacerbated things but things weren’t that great in 2019 either. 

Would we be in a similar state now had Labour been in charge during the 2010s or has all of this been a part of the big bad Tories?

EDIT:

My gut suspicion is that this situation is due to poor retention of staff, necessary austerity given the public finances in 2010 were honestly terrible (as opposed to cutting services for the hell of it) and the realities of an ageing population. And the fact that the NHS may not have the best funding model for our current populations needs.

I guess I’m just incredulous that anyone would deliberately dismantle a healthcare system but then again I genuinely could be wrong. I’d just like to understand this a bit more politically.",-5788197708768870828,0

This win was tighter than many of the polls projected, but Lula's [victory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H5uWRjFsGc&list=RDUwWfE4DAyao&index=2) seems assured.

**EDIT** 22:56 GMT: It is now **statistically impossible** for Lula to lose.

**This was supposed to be the week we got the government’s fiscal plan.**

But with the arrival of a new prime minister, Jeremy Hunt’s financial package has been delayed until 17 November. Expect big cuts and tax rises. The figure being talked about is £50 billion.

**Instead, there’s plenty of lawmaking to be done.**

One government bill making its Commons debut would create a publicly-owned infrastructure bank to invest in projects that tackle the climate emergency or address regional inequality.

**And reshuffles have created a number of select committee chair vacancies.**

Health, Treasury, Education, and Transport are all up for grabs. Select committee chair positions are divided between the parties, and all four of these have to be Tories.

So far, Steve Brine and Anne Marie Morris have been nominated for health, and John Baron and Harriett Baldwin for Treasury.

### MONDAY 31 OCTOBER

**Genetic Technology (Precision Breeding) Bill - report stage and 3rd reading**  
Allows the sale of gene-edited food. Potential mooted uses are to crops more drought-resilient or resistant to diseases. Gene editing differs from genetically modifying in that it's a small, controlled tweak to a living organism’s existing DNA rather than the introduction of a new, foreign gene. Both are de-facto banned in the EU so this is a major post-Brexit divergence from EU law.

**Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill - consideration of Lords amendments**  
Introduces regulation to make smart devices (like smart TVs and speakers) more secure against cyber attacks. Aims to speed up the rollout of mobile, full-fibre and gigabit-capable networks across the UK.

### TUESDAY 1 NOVEMBER

**Internet Access (Children Eligible for Free School Meals) Bill**  
Requires the government to ensure that all children eligible for free school meals have a broadband connection and facilities to access the internet at home. Ten minute rule motion presented by Siobhain McDonagh.

**UK Infrastructure Bank Bill - 2nd reading**  
Completes the setup of the UK Infrastructure Bank, a state-owned but operationally independent bank that invests in projects to tackle climate change and support regional economic growth. Gives the bank the power to lend directly to local authorities and the Northern Ireland Executive. Started in the Lords.

### WEDNESDAY 2 NOVEMBER

**Microplastic Filters (Washing Machines) Bill**  
Requires manufacturers to fit microplastic-catching filters to new domestic and commercial washing machines, among other things. Ten minute rule motion presented by Alberto Costa.

Taxing Wealth is finally beginning to get on the agenda.

Widening wealth inequality is one of the many reasons behind the cost of living crisis

""Tax Wealth Not Work"" #TaxWealthNotWork tackles one of the best tricks that the right wing press and politicians accomplish.  They appeal to the (natural) desire to think of yourself as ""doing well"" & make people who are not particularly well off comparatively  think that THEY are targets for High Taxation.

eg. The person earning 75k with a mortgage they can only just afford and 2.4 kids?  they're ""doing well!"", they don't want to be taxed more by those envious lefties!

Welcome to your weekly Sunday social. This was the result of a great suggestion by one of the community. So if anyone has any suggestions then feel free to send them to us, and successful ones will have a reward with some reddit gold!

The idea behind this is to give LabourUK members a weekly thread that lets everyone have a rest from politics. This will hopefully allow everyone to get to know each other outside of our political views and discuss anything non-political. You never know, you may actually have similar interests! So to keep in the spirit of our authoritarianism, there are a few things first:

1. The subject matter is to try and stay away from politics please

2. Feel free to ask anything

3. New members are more than welcome to contribute, and this may be a chance to introduce yourself to the sub!

4. The normal sub rules will apply to this thread 

So feel free to post whatever you want to moan/chat/raise, talk about your hobbies or anything you like (following rule 1 of course)!",5169122778838942306,0

text of full thread:

I am absolutely thrilled to announce that, as of just now, my Cabinet has agreed to reinstate the Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) grant and introduce a University Bursary for our young people, making us the only borough in England to offer EMA. Education is something I’m passionate about, so when the government scrapped EMA in 2011, I immediately made it my priority to keep this vital payment going during my first term as Mayor. School and university got me to where I am today, allowing me to gain my law degree, and do good for my community. I want those same opportunities for all our young people. I made it clear throughout my election campaign that bringing back EMA and University Bursaries, after the previous administration scrapped both to make ‘savings’, was among my biggest priorities. 

EMA can make all the difference to a student, and help change the course of a young person’s life. It’s the ability to travel to college and gain qualifications, whether it be an apprenticeship or to get to university. That extra boost of money to pay the rent and bills while studying at university can make a huge difference to grades by alleviating the financial strain so many students face. Wealth or class should never stand in the way of opportunity, which is why I am making this worthy investment in the young people of Tower Hamlets. There’s no reason our young people from all walks of life shouldn’t fill the corridors of Oxbridge and Russell Group unis.

\- Lutfur Rahman

it's good to see a socialist council using its powers to make these kind of positive interventions for their constituents. too few Labour councils are willing to do this kind of thing.",4699288760047116120,0
6878,yegz27,"As an outsider, what the absolute fuck is the plan?","Before I get into it i'll be serious: Most of my views align with the Lib Dems, I vote lib dem, and I live and work in a lib dem constituency (where the main opposition is the tories, so don't worry, I won't be campaigning against you, and this is not an info/data grab!) This post may be a tad long so please feel free to ignore it if you do not have the willpower for more politics today. On mobile so please excuse shitty formatting. 

(Side note: I am no fool, I know the value and importance of tactical voting. Labour and Green supporters here lent their votes to us to boot out the tories, and I will be forever thankful.)

Obviously the tories have ripped apart the country and things only stand to get worse as long as they're in power. They know that calling a general would wipe them out, so they'll put it off as long as they can, but eventually it WILL happen and it's reasonably safe to assume they will lose lots of seats, some to us, but most to you. Labour will form the next govt.

Sometimes it's easy to forget the bigger picture, so I wanted to get some idea of what the UK can expect from Labour, mainly on the following:

- What major policy points are Labour likely to take? 

- What's the deal with policies voted on at your conference that Keir Starmer may not push e.g. electoral system reform?

- Will Labour try to reduce the UKs crippling class problem and wage divide, and if so, how?

- What are the plans for housing and the private rented sector?

- What, if any, plans are there for tuition fees and/or student loans?

- General stance on climate change action?

- Where the absolute fuck will you start in terms of tory term damage control?

Of course lots could change between now and the GE, but it's safe to say that Labour will inherit a deeply damaged country, especially the economy (which the tories will inevitably try to blame on you, but nobody's falling for that shit anymore) so I feel it's too early to ask about taxes/NHS/brexit-related issues/all the other important things, but if you happen to know about them i'd be interested to hear it.

The last year has seen unprecedented political turmoil for a party with a 80 seat majority, and imo the underlying cause has been how tough things have been for ordinary families over the past two and half years, firstly the horrors of the pandemic, which led to even more rampant inequality and in turn a collapse in the standard of living for millions of Brits. This had made the general public extremely anxious and generally disdainful/angry towards politicians and means that scandals like 'partygate' or the mini budget are terminal in a way that even say the expenses scandal weren't back in 2009.

To me, all signs point to this getting a hell of a lot worse over the next few months. ONS stats today show the shocking rise of everyday prices, which look set to get even worse: [https://twitter.com/ONS/status/1584790083462258688](https://twitter.com/ONS/status/1584790083462258688), meanwhile rising inflation means that most people are facing a real terms paycut. Research by the The Legatum Institute shows that up to a million people could be forced into poverty this Winter: [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/sep/07/uk-poverty-winter-energy-prices-analysis-shows](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/sep/07/uk-poverty-winter-energy-prices-analysis-shows). Morgan Stanley have said that interest rates hitting 6% could mean 30/40% of UK households will struggle to pay their mortgages: [https://twitter.com/RobinWigg/status/1584479798784466944](https://twitter.com/RobinWigg/status/1584479798784466944), meanwhile rent prices have gone up significantly which looks set to continue with rising interest rates impacting landlords. Meanwhile Hunt has announced he plans to remove Government subsidies energy bills from April: [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-hunt-government-support-energy-bills-b2204261.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-hunt-government-support-energy-bills-b2204261.html) bills are already double what they were last year, and this move is predicted to mean them hitting £6,000 a year, a cost many simply won't be able to afford. 

At the same time that all of this is happening, Sunak and Hunt are proposing another round of 'efficiency savings' on Government spending, AKA austerity round 2. The problem is there's nothing left to cut. We already have A&E's around the country having to turn patients away and hospitals over capacity, a problem that will get much worse over the coming months as we come to the coldest part of the year. Schools will be similarly hard hit. Meanwhile public sector workers are facing huge real terms pay cuts due to inflation and are rightly going to want wage increases. Councils and local Government are going to seriously struggle with further cuts to their funding, and we're likely to see many unable to provide basic services.

Back in the last Tory leadership contest between Truss and Sunak I predicted that the winner wouldn't be able to survive as leader beyond this Winter, and the situation has only got worse after the disastrous mini budget. That prediction remains the same for me. 

I think you're going to see serious public anger towards politicians, which will be reflected in dire opinion polls for the Tories and MPs having to face livid constituents, both of which will make them very nervous. The Conservative party is very divided in my opinion and will quickly turn on Rishi if things get sticky, particularly because he doesn't have an electoral mandate from the general public. He's particularly unpopular with the right of the party, and sadly I can see Farage trying to use that to his advantage and making a return to politics with a far right party, which will further undermine Rishi. I think relatively early in 2023 we'll be facing our fourth Prime Minister in a year. 

What does everyone else think? Am I being overly optimistic/pessimistic (depending on which way you look at it)? Can you see Rishi turning the ship around and leading the Tories to victory like John Major in 1992? Or can the Tories (and the country) reach even new lows?",7010705987631447544,0

7019,yc6nrq,Call Keir write-up | 24/10/2022,"Here's a summary of what Keir Starmer said in his 'call Keir' programme with Nick Ferrari:

- Said there wouldn't be much different between Labour and the Tories on immigration, with the caveat that Labour would **scrap** the Rwanda policy and emphasise students to come to the UK.

- Said that Just Stop Oil were wrong to block roads, citing the fact that ambulances are delayed in getting to where they need to be, he also emphasised that his mum would've been in one of those ambulances as she had to travel in them often. 

- **edit**: He wanted longer sentences for protester who glued themselves to the road and held up these ambulances and commuters in general. 

- Reiterated that Labour would double onshore wind, triple solar and quadruple offshore wind. Keir also committed to **no new oil and gas sites** in the UK. 

- Keir said he'd be 'absolutely fine' against Rishi Sunak in PMQs

- Keir highlighted that Labour would not re-join the EU saying it'd be a 'straight no'. He said we should make Brexit Work, and the current deal we have does not in terms of NI protocol.

- Keir stressed that the UK has to modernise gender recognition laws, and sympathised with the plight that many teenagers and parents have in struggling to get the treatment they need to transition.

- Keir supports all women shortlists.

- Keir said that we need to resolve the strikes by getting people around the table & negotiating. He supports those striking as people need a pay rise. He cited the Welsh Labour Government, as they have made a deal with the unions in terms of pay - the UK government should follow this example. Says he would never go on a picket line as Labour leader. Shadow minister colleagues would be permitted to visit a picket line on a case-by-case basis, but on principle no shadow minister should attend one.

- Admits that a no-confidence vote would be ineffective as it would unite the Tory Party.

- Labour are not going to attend the world cup in Qatar, but Keir will still be watching it at home. Says this is a deep regret but human rights must come first.

- Keir Starmer said Liz Truss should NOT receive her £115,000 for being PM. Would bar her from this.

- Keir supports Tony Adams in Strictly. For those have haven't seen Tony's entertaining performance on Saturday you can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=s-3f3dxOxfg)!

7039,ybjqmd,Rosie Duffield needed to go yesterday; the best time for Labour is now.,"There are an absolute plethora of instances (as if multiple were needed) that prove that Rosie Duffield is an absolute liability to the Labour Party, all of which have to do with her incessant ramblings against trans people.

If you were to just look up her name today on Google, here is what comes up:

* A Telegraph article pandering to the gender-choice minority about how transgender gender identity 'compromises' the rights of women and children.
* Her speaking at an LGB Alliance event, a """"""charity"""""" so blatant in its bigotry that it's disgusting it had a Labour MP speak on their behalf.
* A Kent Online article about how Duffield would refuse to use Eddie Izzard's pronouns of she/her, followed by;
* A PinkNews article on how she's threatening to quit the Labour party over the latter and her intention to run in Sheffield as an MP.

If calling a person by their preferred pronouns is the breaking point for which a Labour MP will openly speak about whether or not they'll be aligned with the party, then it demonstrates how transparently little their commitment to the Labour movement is.

I recognise that Duffield isn't alone in her viewpoints in Labour; Diana Johnson of Hull North, Tonia Antoniazzi of Gower and Marsha De Cordova of Battersea, all have also put themselves out there as gender-critical too, and while I have disdain for them just as equally, Duffield is the shameless figurehead of this rancid behaviour, always pointing out how she's being victimised and silenced, despite the conspicuous pedestal she's almost always given in media.

I understand that Starmer (and Sarwar) haved decided to try and teeter this tightrope, posturing about how it's 'not on' yet doing nothing about it (beyond pro-trans policy like committing to banning trans conversion therapy, which I concede is good albeit the bare minimum); admittedly, in the game of politics, I also understand that the horrific act of recognising trans rights would probably end up with negative backlash in this country, and reiterate the stereotype of 'woke lefty Labour focusing on infinity genders' that seems to have permeated.

However, right now, Labour couldn't be any fucking further ahead if they tried; with the current media storm, anything Labour does right now would be undermined by the circus of the Conservatives continuing to implode.

If you're looking at this in a pragmatic way of media attention, there wouldn't be a better time than right now for Starmer to remove the whip, give a vague statement about how Duffield doesn't represent Labour values, and then let Boris Johnson's reappointment + fallout dominate the airwaves.

Letting Duffield continue to do as she pleases before the ticking time bomb of her defection comes to explode will do more damage to Labour than controlling the situation itself and catching her out. She's a detriment to Labour getting in power, let alone an entirely vile bigot, and I'd rather have her forcefully deselected to keep Labour on top of it as opposed to TERFs trying to dominate the conversation once again.

If candidates are (supposedly) being withheld from representing Labour due to liking tweets, then one long scroll through Duffield's likes should be more than enough to prevent her from representing anything to do with Labour ever again.",-4754455178442660714,0

**Parliamentary business is overshadowed again this week.**

There's the small issue of who our next prime minister will be. It's (thankfully) a quick process, so we'll find out this week. But that creates a strange situation where ministers answering questions in the Commons may not be in post next week.

**But some major lawmaking is still set to happen.**

Probably most notably is the government bill to scrap all EU law that isn't incorporated into UK law by the end of next year. It's a huge endeavour and the implications will be far reaching.

**Friday brings private members' bills.**

WEDNESDAY 26 OCTOBER

**Consumer Telephone Service Standards Bill**Introduces maximum waiting times for customers who contact utility providers by phone, with penalties for companies that don't comply. Ten minute rule motion presented by Robert Halfon.

**Identity and Language (Northern Ireland) Bill - committee stage, report stage, and 3rd reading**Gives the Irish language official recognition in Northern Ireland, and requires an Irish Language Commissioner to promote its use by public authorities.

He comes across as fairly smart, competent and inoffensive. I also think he's a more skilled debater/interviewer than Starmer. That means Labour should be worried, right? 

Eh, sort of. 

Sunak will be inheriting the most unpopular Tory Party in a generation. They face unprecedented electoral wipeout in the current polls. That is largely due to Johnson's various scandals and Truss's sheer incompetence. The wisdom is that if Sunak gets and ""stabilises the ship"" so to speak, the Tories might just have a chance of clawing back some support. 

I don't think it's anywhere near that simple. Sunak will immediately have to deal with the cost of living crisis and a crumbling economy. I've said before that the only possible redemption for the Tories at this point is for them to immediately put together a crisis relief programme. These measures would make the Covid measures and even Corbyn's proposals pale in comparison, but will be the only way to ensure that people are protected from the COL crisis. And it will likely have to happen at the expense of the wealthy. 

The problem is that while I think Sunak is more willing to compromise than Johnson/Truss, I can't see him flipping his entire ideology, even if that's what it takes to beat the crisis and redeem the Tory party in the eyes of the electorate. Because of that, Labour will retain a distinct advantage.

Lastly, while I think Sunak is a better performer than Starmer, I think he's distinctively unlikeable and uncharismatic. He comes across as a cocky, private school/Oxbridge rich kid who talks down to ordinary people and doesn't understand or care about the problems they face. His wealth and luxurious lifestyle are going to be a disadvantage in the days to come. He's going to be marching around in a £1000 suit while people struggle to eat. I don't think Starmer is *great* in terms of charisma or being in touch with ordinary people, but he's nowhere near as distinctively out of touch as Sunak.

TL;DR: Labour should not be complacent, but the Tory brand is buried for at least a generation, and Sunak lacks either the ideological will or the personality to turn their fortunes around.",-8627781848412499101,0

But I haven't seen anyone set out how exactly we'd go about raising anything like enough taxes or what approach we could take to borrowing and why we're happy it wouldn't freak out markets again and/or cause more problems down the track (especially as I understand interest rates inc for govt are now much higher). Edit: to be clear its not that I haven't heard ideas for taxes just not arguments about how these add up to big enough amounts to touch the sides in this context.


This isn't a 'you're wrong come fight me'. I'm not anything like an economist and don't have a theory as to why there isn't a way through without tough choices. I am also pro progressive tax including wealth tax if it can be made to work. 

But I just don't really understand what the assumptions are when it's suggested the circumstances shouldn't create any real impediment.

He said sack the strikers, “the queues will be in Calais and not Dover” and “Boris is the real deal”, if say for example Ed Miliband were to say any of that stuff but about Corbyn he would be slaughtered by the Daily Mail and would totally done. 

People will look back at Boris Johnson’s time as prime minister with nostalgia and humour. People will start calling his “bojo” and “boris” again, the daily mail will start mocking Angela Rayner and calling Kier Starmer boring again. The current support of the Labour Party is like the support of the democrats in 2020 presidential election. Even Right leaning liberals and “Corbynists” are pushing this monuments force that the Labour Party currently is. The only goal for the conservatives is to win the next general election and Boris Johnson is the man to do that. Remember my point about forgiving and forgetting, people have done that with Johnson his whole life, I believe people are stupid enough to do that again with Johnson. 

I would personally like a general election but my second choice would be Penny Mordant, It would be a similar situation to Theresa May, left with a huge mess but eventually resulting in somebody way out of their depths, and three resignations in one/two years highlighting how awful and split the torries are.

Think about it, we had everything Brexit caused for years, taking down 2 Prime Ministers. All the while having Boris Johnson in the background and Cabinet of these PMs, causing problems.

Then Boris becomes Prime Minister and immediately takes over Britain when it faces down the barrel of a global pandemic which'll paralyse the British economy and kill hundreds of thousands.

A series of lies and scandals which seem too insane to be true (sarcasm) take down Boris, the man who wanted to be world king. Faced with an eye-watering amount of Cabinet resignations, including his Chancellor, he finally relents and leaves the job (and Priti Patel leaves which is a welcome bonus).

Only for his successor, Boris' foreign secretary, to almost instantly oversee the death of the much-loved Queen Elizabeth II, only to cause the pound to crash, 2 cabinet ministers to resign and massive economic instability in less than a month. They then resign just 44 days into the job.

And then, Boris Johnson makes a comeback, rushing home from holiday and (according to sources inside Bojos campaign team) achieving the required 100 supporters, next to Rishi Sunak.

Some of Boris Johnsons old allies like his Chief of Staff, Deputy Prime Minister and Health Secretary are supporting his rival.

Boris Johnson now faces an election to take back the top job, and his opponent, is his former Chancellor and friend.

Get some amazing actors, add some storylines and character building, and this could genuinely be an actually decent political drama, like a British House of Cards, or a The Crown spinoff focussed around Boris.

I can understand this, if it was one new leader carrying out the previous manifesto. That hasnt been what has been happening.

The Conservative party has declared that yesterday's vote on Fracking was a confidence vote in its government. Whilst they won this, it has subsequently lead to the downfall of the government as it has become clear several MPs have no confidence in the PM, for the second time in a year. If a government collapses from a no confidence vote a general election should be called.

Labour and other opposition parties need to urgently launch legal action, arguing these points, particularly that the vote was seen as a vote of confidence, (including that some MPs were physically forced to vote for the government) and therefore parliament should be dissolved and a general election called.

7254,y8qpb1,What is Labour's solution to the energy crisis?,"They want to ban fracking which is fair enough, but what are they actually going to do?

My understanding (which I admit may be wrong) is this:  Most of our energy is generated from power stations that are run on natural gas imported from the EU through Russia.  The Nord Stream is ""down for maintenance"" and our gas storage reserves are and were already at a historical low even before the Kent facility blew up and green energy only makes up something like 12% of what we need.

Nuclear energy development in this country has been in a stop start state of affairs for about 15 years now even though it was reported under the last Labour government that that our current situation would develop unless the next and successive governments from 2010 onwards did something to prevent it, which obviously hasn't happened, and to top it off it is also known that we couldn't meet carbon neutral pledges without building new nuclear stations.  Further, our nuclear stations for the most part are basically on their last legs having had their life extended to continue producing power and are under frequent safety reviews because of this meaning they could be shutting down entirely within the next 7 or so years.

It seems to me like decisions were made that left us wholly reliant on Russia for our energy future because the public don't want fracking, nor to reopen the coal mines, and new nuclear power is also off the table making the long and short of it that we don't generate enough power to be even close to energy independent and the public by and large don't support any tried and tested method of stable and reliable energy production.

So how exactly do Labour plan on fixing that?

EDIT: I wasn't aware Norway were back to exporting the bulk of our gas? Are they? I've not been able to confirm it. I thought the main gas works was still closed do to the fire that happened around the time of the first lockdown.  If so, that's something at least but this small improvement doesn't address the bigger issues this country has regarding energy.",-447273322734473463,0

The Telegraph are reporting that the favourite to be the Labour candidate for Barking at the next election, Darren Rodwell (who is white), is being investigated by the party after he told a Black History Month event he had “the worst tan possible for a black man” and had the “passion of the rhythm” for dancing to black music. Rodwell is on the party's 'long list' to the MP for Barking.  

In his defence, Rodwell has apologised for the comments and said ""Through representing Barking & Dagenham, I have worked tirelessly everyday to build a better world for my community, my family, and for my son who experiences racism in his life. I saw off the BNP with a coalition of colleagues from different backgrounds and that is the cornerstone of my leadership. I will continue to learn and to strive for representation in my area if I am selected to be Labour’s candidate for Barking."" ([https://twitter.com/DarrenRodwell/status/1582291913624809472](https://twitter.com/DarrenRodwell/status/1582291913624809472))

Now I don't know much about Darren, but whilst these comments are shocking, I hope he isn't barred from standing on the back of them alone.

However, the fact that he was allowed to be on the party's long list for Barking, despite these comments being public knowledge, clearly shows the double standard with candidates on the left like Maurice Macleod, who is a long term anti-racist campaigner but was barred for liking a tweet by Caroline Lucas. 

There's a good article on this by Simon Fletcher, who worked for both Corbyn and Starmer, which clearly outlines how the party has reached new levels of factionalism under Starmer and the problems this might cause in a Starmer government: [https://bylinetimes.com/2022/10/18/keir-starmer-squeeze-of-the-left-is-a-worrying-sign-of-things-to-come/](https://bylinetimes.com/2022/10/18/keir-starmer-squeeze-of-the-left-is-a-worrying-sign-of-things-to-come/)",7010705987631447544,0

This is partly to identify any suspicious looking behaviour, but it's primarily aimed at making sure that they're in a reasonable financial position (i.e, they don't have unmanageable debt).

The reason for this is simple: it's much harder to bribe someone who's in a comfortable position with good savings than it is to bribe someone who's deep in debt that they can't pay. And particularly in the last year, a lot of people have ended up in that position - just look at all the stories about police officers having to use food back in the last year.

In theory people are meant to report changes in their financial circumstances so that they can be reviewed - but if doing so could cost your clearance and your job then many people won't. So we end up in a position where it's harder to vet new people, and many of the people who had previously been vetted are now in much weaker financial positions than they were.

And that's a dangerous position to be in, because it means that we have a lot of vetted people who are much more susceptible to bribery than they were thought to be, whether that's from journalists, criminal gangs, or foreign intelligence.

* This polling won't hold up when the Tories get rid of Johnson

* This polling won't hold up when the Tory leadership election is finished

* This polling won't hold up when the Tories start throwing money around

* This polling won't hold up when the Tories get rid of Truss

Can we now perhaps start to accept that this polling *will* in fact hold up, and that Labour is going to win a good majority at the next election?

For the 'this polling won't hold up' crowd, which Tory MP do you think is riding to their rescue? Which Tory MP is winning over the internal factions, their batshit membership *and* the electorate?

It's over. We might be at the high water mark currently, and we're unlikely to actually get 56% in the next election, but it's functionally over. 

The Tories are not recovering to an election-challenging level from where they are now. They need a total reset of everything from an ideological standpoint, and that will probably happen in multiple stages as it did from 1997 to 2010. They need to go through a 'Hague-Duncan Smith-Howard-Cameron' arc again to return to contention.

Labour did just that kind of reset, but we did it on a speed run from 2015 to 2019.

Let's all embrace the fact that we're now reaching the party's sunlit uplands. We're going back to our constituencies and preparing for government, if you will.

Let's focus on what the party's priorities should be in government instead of desperately pulling on the most insignificant threads of doubt.

Let's commit to all doing our parts over the coming weeks or months until the election to deliver the result beyond any doubt.",-3738693184451660781,0

So far all I've seen publicised is a commitment to net zero by 2030 (which is great), great British energy (which I'm unclear about) and rail nationalisation as big ones.

Reading the website we have the stronger together report which names a ton of great concrete things like a commitment to doubling the size of the cooperative sector, a £28bn/a commitment to green investment, repealing trade union restrictions, insourcing public services, the Hillsborough law, criminal justice reform, access to mental health support within a month, taxing private schools, free school meals and out of term income support for families, parental leave expansion and reform, childcare expansion and ending no fault evictions.

Is this website information still relevant? It mentions the war in Ukraine so has been updated relatively recently. Do you think Starmer's Labour would implement all of this if we get into government? What do you feel is missing from the roadmap?",-5428130044304546311,0

I feel as though the window of acceptable standard thought almost inevitably will shift dramatically to the left whereby Starmer is suddenly considered a right winger (I know he is, but in the eyes of the British public) despite being ideologically consistent. 

This is because, with an absent conservative party, the left wing of the Labour party become a larger opposition force than the conservatives. The majority of dialogue starts to attack Starmer from the left instead of right and so overtime the public begin to see centrist instead of right wing policy as the norm. As a result Starmer is either forced the make concession or wage war against leftism rather than conservatism - depending on whatever position he finds himself in a couple years down the line.

You’ve seen the polls, Keith’s making the labour parties lead drop faster than - sack of shit, he may still win during a general election, but then we are still left with a Tory in disguise…

The voting record of most individuals of the Labour Party and of course without question the entire Tory party are bloody questionable and I’m fed up with the argument of “wasted vote” or “you’re voting Tory by not voting labour”, oh fuck off that’s not how politics work, we are trapped in a 2 party system because of this exact complacency and idiocy by continuing this game of ping pong politics between the tories and labour.

I’m specifically looking for input from those like minded to myself. And I think it’s a common trend when people start a company, look at profits and greed too easily, and forget their morals.

The business will be selling 100% organic, naturally sourced and ethically manufactured bamboo, from clothes to toiletries. 

How can I better make my company, a company for the left, ie for the people and not for capitalism. 

Factors to include:

I will be making (what I see to be) a significant profit, whilst still being cheaper than all bamboo alternatives in the UK (and being the only one that’s 100% organic and natural). All the other firms make a considerable mark up which is completely unnecessary. 

I have also introduced a policy whereby our production will be limited if and when it becomes more unsustainable than it does good to produce. (Bamboo linen [not rayon] is far more efficient than cotton and most other alternatives. This is our degrowth policy.

We are also working to create a trade system for those unable to afford new clothes, that they can pay with old clothes that we will upcycle or breakdown and recycle. 

And finally, profits will be invested into various trusts that protect the natural habitats for pandas and other endangered animals.

It isn't simply ""workers vs billionaires"" in Britain","I have highlighted a comment posted here that has over 400 upvotes at current from the recent ""British attitudes to wealth"" thread because it touches on something fundamental to the British economy, from housing crisis to wage stagnation - in turn, understanding this concept collectively is something that can make the left either an effective force or completely inept. The post can be seen here:  [https://imgur.com/a/SlgegHq](https://imgur.com/a/SlgegHq)

The idea that ""we're all in it together"" (anyone remember that phrase?) as a group of workers vs the evil billionaires, no matter whether you're on 10k or 200k is a nice notion, but it is also a nonsense that's used to make sure effective change cannot happen.

Whether you want to call them PMCs (professional managerial classes), bourgeoisie or any other collective terminology, ""workers"" in the upper wage margins are largely not political allies. They have become part of a different class due to their ability to acquire capital - capital which is then used to make normal people's lives more difficult.

The massive decrease in bargaining power for working class people in Britain since the 80s (since industry was destroyed and union membership subsequently attacked/collapsed) has lead to a direct increase in the bargaining power of PMCs (eg £150k a year people).

This has created a massive chasm between the spending and purchasing power of people on lower or median wages, and those on higher incomes. In turn, we see housing crisis, and wage stagnation because working class people are priced out of the market by PMCs who can afford to buy assets like land and housing not to live in, but as a speculative asset to generate profit.

If you have a business of 200 people for example, you have to pay all your workers - skilled or unskilled (I know those terms aren't great but I'm using them for the sake of argument). A unionised workforce can collectively bargain for better wages, meaning there's less in the wage pot for the professional managerial classes - they'll still earn plenty, but they'll earn less - and this is something they don't want.

Because of the destruction of working class people's bargaining power (again, via the far less unionised labour, attacks on the social safety net, pop growth), we've seen a political shift that has normalised psychotic politics like neoliberalism and austerity - these policies **benefit the professional managerial classes while taking from normal and working class people. This is true in both the Tory party and the right wing of the Labour party.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Want to understand why New Labour under Blair had a worse record on inequality than Thatcher and built zero council houses, creating housing crisis?

Want to understand why Keir Starmer is funded by billionaires and hedgefund managers and gives 6 figure payouts to those who intentionally sabotaged Labour's electoral prospects from within the party?

Want to understand why Tory MPs are being invited to the Labour party across the floor while simultaneously suggesting ""we all need to vote labour to get these horrible Tories out"". Why Nye Bevan, a former coal miner, was booted from the party for calling Tories *lower than vermin?*

# It's because there is a chasm not only in life experiences, but in political and economic interests between working class people and those in the professional managerial classes.

If normal working people earn more (like in Scandinavia), prices will go up by some degree, as will the median wage. This means you have a far wider middle class, great for common prosperity and poverty but bad for the bargaining power of the higher earners (PMCs) who previously enjoyed the fruits and low prices of a low wage economy.

A wider middle class via reduced inequality is an excellent thing for Britain as a country but the PMCs, Blairites, Starmerites, Tories,  you name it, all fear it because it reduces the imaginary status they've created for themselves and it **increases competition for them.** Hence the massive hysteria about Jeremy Corbyn's basic Nordic socdem platform.

Want to understand why it wasn't an urgent cost of living crisis in the media over the past two decades while young people saw hundreds of percent increases in their rents and housing costs in relation to their wages? It's because that crisis benefits the wealthiest, therefore it's not a problem.

Working class people derive their bargaining power from collective bargaining (things like unions, threat of strike action, strength in numbers), while PMCs with the free time and capital to invest in more niche skills (or to sell their souls in some cases) derive their bargaining power from there being a limited supply of those skills. This ultra-market approach is completely ok with poverty, as the market doesn't care about poverty, nor humanity, nor society.

Please can we discuss this more? I have already written too much for it to be a fun read, so please do ask questions - I'll gladly to into more depth and I'm sure other people will chime in.

**TLDR; It isn't  simply workers vs billionaires, that's largely a fantasy spread by the upper middle classes to protect their own interests and the status quo.**

7501,yo8v70,a question about the EU,"First of all, idk much about EU and I'm genuinely trying my best to ask in good faith.

So what's the deal with the EU? Is it good? Bad? It seems that leftists can be quite divided when it comes to the organisation. From EU stans to EU haters.

For Example, I'm pretty sure that Communist Party Britain is against the EU or at least they're very critical of it while labour was for remaining in the EU while their leader was Jeremy Corbyn and he wasn't exactly a Tory in disguise.

I recognise that it's convenient to be a part of the EU because of the opportunities and freedom of movement along with the free healthcare and university in some countries, but is there a moral argument to be against being part of the EU?

Sweden's far-right is growing, Italy literally has a fascist party in power, Le Pen almost won in France and I've heard that Spain's government implemened a lot of progressive stuff this year because their right-wing is gaining power. So, would it be worth rejoining the EU if it only becomes more right-wing from now on? 

I mean I take a look at r Europe and the vast majority of comments are cheering on Italy for closing it's borders and leaving migrants stranded. And I thought r UK was right-wing when it came to migrants!

My opinion on the EU is that it's an undemocratic organisation with huge inequality between its member states and none of them care about refugees (reminds me of the UK). The EU's beginnings was all about being economically liberal, but all I hear is capitalism.

I mean c'mon. We're talking about a few rich countries and lots of poorer countries in 1 organisation that's all about making cooperation easier. It just seems that it exists to make poorer countries much more malleable tbh. Stuff like grater economic freedom just means it's easier for businesses to make profit, and we know where that profit goes to.

Also I'd appreciate if any of you can point out great videos or articles that's critical of the EU.

Thank you to everyone who's commented, it's been good to hear people's experiences and opinions, had some very interesting discussions in the comments. All the best to the lot of ya!

What is with British people and wealth? Just saw a post asking whether people on £150k actually have a hard time and the overwhelming response was ""rich people have problems too, they just have a different reality and it's completely valid""... 

Let's put this into context - if you earn £150k, your take home income after tax is £7k PER MONTH. Some people rightly said that over £50k of a £150k salary goes on tax, but it should be the case that the richest in society pay more. They're the only ones that can. That also still leaves you with £7k per month to take home.

Many others said the biggest problem is the companies and millionaires not paying more, and that they're the real rich people. It's right that the super wealthy are the biggest problem and something needs to be done, but still, no one seems to accept that £7k a month is plenty to live on. That's 4x the amount per month that someone on £25k sees. Pointing to bigger companies is just deflecting. 

There were even sob stories about how people on £150k or more have been hit by huge mortgage rises that they just can't afford, but if you take out a mortgage that costs the majority of £7k per month, how do people not see that as irresponsible financial planning? Whatever your salary, if your living costs take up over a certain portion of your income, you're not preparing for a change of income or harder circumstances. The difference is rich people have more room to avoid making this mistake.

Not everyone will get the opportunity to earn £150k, and rich people are incredibly quick to tell the poor to ""budget better"" and ""live within their means"", but when their income is harmed and they claim they spend most of their wealth, we're supposed to feel sorry for them. Someone said that ""people on £150k are closer to homeless people than millionaires and billionaires"", and the logic is correct, but the fact that £7k A MONTH is closer to homelessness than the richest in our society is sickening, and the idea that even that much income isn't a stable amount to live on is frankly ludicrous.

You could argue that taking out huge mortgages is within your means if £150k is your regular salary, and you could also argue that no-one could pre-empt huge interest rate or mortgage rises (and you'd at least be right about the latter). The problem with this is that it massively overlooks the idea of having a ""rainy day fund"". Again, we're always told that if we don't have a rainy day fund, no matter what we earn, we're irresponsible with our finances. The media, the government, the richest and even the poorest all adhere to this line of thinking.

There's nothing wrong with being responsible with your finances, but with the cost of rent/mortgages, transport, food and bills, most people are lucky if they put away couple of hundred pounds each month. Add children and childcare to that mix and your savings are non-existent. 

Case in point: back in 2019 I was on £20 - 21k. I could walk to work, paid moderate rent, and lived in a relatively pricey city. I do not have kids. I made a deliberate note to put away £200 a month every month to build up some savings, and in just over a year and a half, I had put away about £3.5k. That's HALF of what someone on £150k earns A MONTH. Unfortunately for me, I lost my job in the pandemic and ended up on Universal Credit. Those savings disappeared within 6 months and I fell back into an overdraft.

Did I go out for a beer with my friends every now and then? Absolutely. Could I have saved even more per month? Sure. Would it have saved me much more each month? Hardly likely (and it definitely would have made life significantly more miserable). Two years later and I have finally recovered from my financial losses. (Not a sob story, just using it as an example). 

If you're earning £7k per month and you can't amass a rainy day fun that could cover your living costs for 6 months, how are you living within your means? And why should people feel sorry for you for having more of a chance to prepare for the worst and refusing to do so?

Don't get me wrong, you should be able to have a better lifestyle with a better salary, but not seeing that those additional earnings are a significant privilege is astounding. Not recognising your misue of that privilege is not worthy of sympathy and does not ""put you in the same boat as everyone else"", and the fact that the UK at large doesn't seem to recognise the disparity between £150k and many other salaries is infuriating. It's even worse that the UK perpetually tells the poor that losing money is their fault for being ""financial irresponsible"" but rich people can fail to prepare and that's supposed to deserve sympathy.

Why do I also support economic refugees? First of all, I believe everyone should be entitled to seek a better life, I didn’t fucking choose to be born here it was all chance… 

Secondly, if someone is willing to travel thousands of miles across dozens of countries over months to then risk their life to cross the sea in a dinghy, they already have a better desire for a better life than half the people in this country and on top of that, are clearly willing to put their life on the line for a better life.

Lastly, and most importantly, refugees are smart, if your country is invaded over capitalism by the support of half the western world , do you A. Continue your 9-5 office job until you die, or do you B. Leave and get away from any war of capitalism.

On to the title:

I myself want to leave the UK, not because I hate the place for what it is, but for what it’s becoming. We are undeniably becoming a fascist state, we also offer the worst support for asylum seekers out of some of the major countries (£35 pw and not allowed to work) - but like our friends over the pond, we have always liked to show off “the wealth” we have, but it’s all false, half the “nice” stuff in the UK that is seen by tourists or depicted in the media’s abroad are either financed or owned by the very few that have even blessed with golden opportunities, or really, born into it.

As a non binary individual that has lived in France, Sweden, and the Netherlands I personally do not feel safe anymore in the UK purely because of my identity - and yes I do recognise those other countries are following similar trends

Essentially what I’m trying to say is that the UK is NOT safe for these decent humans that are risking it all for what I see as nothing in return. Shouldn’t we be honest to our fellow comrades by broadcasting the reality of this capitalistic state in ruin - or maybe we are just witnessing the long and painful death of capitalism.

I was all the way into the conspiracy theory world. I listened to Alex Jones' show every day as well as other shows and also lots of bible prophecy endtime NWO theory podcasts. World government, luciferian globalists, mark of the beast microchips and biometrics, vaccine poisons, antichrist UN - I bought into all of this and probably more I can't bring to mind now.

This was before flat earth got any traction, and I was never into the reptilian stuff (that was still a small but significant portion of conspiracy theory circles back then), nor was I sucked in by the antisemitic parts but tbh whatever flavour of conspiracy theory it is the thought process and background context is much the same.

If you have friends or family you have lost to these things, maybe I can help you make some progress getting them out? Or if you're just interested in how people get into these things or get out of them, of if you just want to understand why they would believe these things ask away. Thought it may be of use.

But currently on Thursday they have the latest series of Alexi Sayle's Imaginary Sandwich Bar. I know he gets some stick from the left for being rich (but us proper leftists know the mantra - socialism doesn't want to take your toothbrush off you) but he's pretty bang on the money both politically and comedically.

Very refreshing to hear comedy that isn't just ""isn't Boris Johnson's hair funny!"" And of course, I might be biased as a fellow Scouser.

Bonus mention for Doug Stanhope - not left wing as such, often described as ""libertarian"" but despite being American, not in the mental right wing US definition. He's more a left wing libertarian and his political commentary on what is wrong with the right wing American political landscape is very cutting and vicious compared to the usual ""don't want to upset the establishment"" soft comedy you get from American comedians.

(maybe theyre better here, though, idk). so, i wanted to ask in a place that 100% aligns with my values aha!

to be a bit specific with stuff i’d want to donate, i was thinking about getting a humidifier for the winter months to prevent nosebleeds that i always get. that would be rly inconvenient to bring back to the states, though, so i would want to donate it somewhere where it could go to someone who would need it here. same with a throw blanket i purchased. it would just take up suitcase space, and i have plenty of blankets like that at home. location-wise, i’m in london, but definitely wouldnt mind traveling out of my borough to go somewhere. as long as the tube reaches it, i’m good with the location!

So I, as a decent human being, put my dog on the fucking lead when I see another dog.

So many cunts just let their dog run up and say ""don't worry, he's friendly"". Fuck you, cockwomble. Your dog might be friendly, mine might bite your dog's face off. So fuck off.

I didn't grow up in the UK, so there are some aspects of language which I haven't quite come to terms with. For example, I've never quite got all of the nuances of the word 'sunshine' in conversation. 

Typically it's said by someone trying to show a weird kind of superiority to people 'better watch out, sunshine, or I'll put your head through a wall' - but is there some hidden homophobic / racist subtext to it? From context, I assume so, but I'm not sure why that word in particular.

What is shocking today is that in all the articles and posts I have seen, there is an alarming amount of people that are responding with things such as “Losing support from the general public who don't wish to be associated with criminal damage” and “This is just vandalism, sue them for criminal damage lol”. In fact these type of comments far outweigh any other.

It is the groups of 55 Tufton Street that has been turning the general public against these types of protests, to divert them from the issue that is actually being raised.

Climate protesters block roads, there will be headlines that an ambulance was blocked. Whether it actually happens or not (I’ve only seen one video where this might be the case, but it was then let through), climate change is a much bigger issue.

Climate protesters chain themselves to airport gates, there will be headlines about them causing huge delays for holiday goers. However these huge delays are nothing to do with the protesters as they were happening before and after due to a staff shortage.

Now with all this smoke and mirrors the right to protest is slowly being stripped away piece by piece in the UK, with recently the Government is in the process of implementing law that will allow protesters to be given an ankle tag, possible jail time and fines, all without being charged

But if Sunak had any commitment to that heritage he'd work to repatriate all the stolen items the UK hasn't let go of. In addition to the Kohinoor diamond in the crown jewels, I imagine he could also empty out the burglar's gallery known as the British Museum. He won't, there will be enough animosity amongst the tory voter base having a PM that ""isn't british"" even though he was born and raised in the posh English elite, and I highly doubt he will do anything of substance against the ocean of imperial nostalgia that just refuses to recede. It'll just be the same rubbish in a shiny ""progressive"" coating.

8073,ycvt9u,Our education system is designed to fail,"It is  not the teacher's fault. I used to work as an English teacher and in support. I want to share my opinion. 

To start with, teachers are paid so little that it only attracts 2 types of people. 1/ People who can't earn 20k any other way 2/ Idealists that just want to help- who are saints. This second type of people do not deserve the kind of abuse and manipulation from the system. 

The system is designed to fail. If you are not getting an education from your time in school, I have wonderful news: The system is working exactly as intended!

Public schools are deliberately under funded and it attracts awful people as teachers. Some teachers are incapable of educating but so long as they are punctual, public schools don't really care if their students learn anything. It makes it incredibly difficult for students to learn the most important thing that education has to offer any young student: Critical thinking. That is, the ability to analyse an issue without accepting it as either true or false. To not just understand the research and poignant principals underpinning an issue but to be able to rationalise the legitimacy of that reaearch and those principals. 

You are supposed to hate education: If you hate education. It makes you weary of learning new thing and to push your barriers. I am not just talking on an academic level. On a personal level. In sense of growth. Public education stagnates young people.

Public school is designed to prepare you to be a factory worker. An office ant. Creativity is systematically stomped. Children sit in rows, in the exact same uniform and are told to behave with conformity. They are punished for acting different, for being themselves. Children are dissuaded from helping other students. 

Being a teacher was awful, degrading, belittling. But not because of the kids. Kids these days are difficult, but you are prepared for that and the little wins are very gratifying. But the school system is run like a supermarket. Educators report to a manager. And just like all industry, the manager doesn't know shit, is a useless beaurocrat. Is a poor educator, if an educator at all. But they know the head master or are in with the trust that underfunded the school, so they get the 30k+ position to be a glorified bully. 

This is not education. This is indoctrination.",386136758450216487,0

8157,ycgl6t,Different alternatives to austerity 2.0,"Ever since the reaction to Liz Truss's 'mini-budget', I've been reading a lot about government fiscal policy and macroeconomics and trying to get my head around different ways of understanding how the economy and state spending interact. I feel, after two or three weeks of that, I definitely have a better idea of the different theories/policies, but wanted to make sure I'd got things straight and maybe open up a debate about the merits and problems with each perspective (on the basis I've understood them correctly that is!). 

I think my main confusion has centred around untangling what is an actual economic constraint from what is just an ideological decision. For instance, a lot of commentators keep mentioning the '£40bn fiscal hole' left by Truss's 'mini-budget' and how this hole needs to be filled with either taxes, spending cuts, or a combination of the two. But then I've also read that this £40bn hole purely comes from fiscal rules the UK government have kind of arbitrarily made up. This, however, raises the question of why the Tories wouldn't just change that rule slightly, not have to raise tax or cut spending as much, and possibly regain some popularity. I'm sure it's more complicated than that, and there are ideological reasons, but that's one thing I can't quite get my head around. 

Aside from that, my main interest is understanding what alternatives there are to austerity, or 'sound money' as Starmer puts it. I just want to check I've understood two of the alternatives by outlining them below briefly. 

1. Austerity isn't necessary because government debt/the deficit isn't actually a problem. Deficit spending, on the contrary, is a good thing and is a policy that should be purused during an economic crisis/recession. Government debt is also something which the government can always pay off because they issue the currency and therefore can always just print more money to pay it off. As far as I understand, this is what modern monetary theory (MMT) is saying about the issue the UK is facing right now. I can't tell if this approach also includes taxing the rich more to pay off the deficit or, because debt can just be paid off by printing more money, there's no need to raise taxes except for to control inflation. 
2. The second option seems to come from people on the left who are critics of MMT. This approach, first and foremost, seems to be about taxing the rich. It means an overhaul of the tax system in the UK to tax wealth more and to ease the burden on those earn more of their money through work. As well as raising taxes on the rich, this school of thought also seems to advocate for changing the arbitrary fiscal rules the government currently has (paying down the debt within three years or something?). It means investing big (through deficit spending) in parts of the economy that will lead to growth and therefore more tax revenue in the future to pay back the debt accrued through deficit spending. This school of thought, however, still seems to be attached so some sort of orthodoxy in terms of taxes being raised to pay off the debt, not simply the Bank of England printing more money to pay it off. It therefore seems to still be about showing fiscal responsibility, but the idea of what is responsible is different (not balancing the books, but investing in ways which lead to growth). 

I'd really like to know if I've misunderstood the current anti-austerity debates out there and if there any other options other than those two. Also very happy to hear pros and cons of each!",-8915965856644229698,0

8161,yc08fm,Can't we cease with the Liz Truss circlejerk now?,"**So obviously Liz Truss is tory scum. This post isn't trying to defend her.**

What I take issue with is the fact that suddenly every single problem in the UK was suddenly blamed on a single person when there is an entire economic class at fault. 

The Tory party fucked the economy, the Tory party on behalf of the ruling classes of this country. When we blame a single person, however horrible they are (and tbf Truss is pretty horrible) we risk thinking all our problems will be solved we just get the 'right person' or a 'good party' into power. This is idealistic thinking. It's the sort of thinking that ensures nothing changes. Change only comes when you eliminate the power of the entire ownership class.

What's fucked the working class people in this country is an ideology called neo-liberalism. Neo-liberalism has been promoted by the past 8 Prime Ministers. It was first brought into British politics by a PM called Margaret Thatcher. What neo-liberalism entails is reaction towards social democracy and social reforms. It means the eradication of worker's rights and reducing job security to nil, privatisation of public services, reduced funding to social programs, fewer regulations on private firms, and, ultimately, organising an economy to serve the already rich and powerful in their profit-making agenda. 

Most of the recent economic crises, of which the working class suffered the most, was the result of neo-liberalism. Much of the country still hasn't recovered from the 2008 crisis. Covid hit harder because of neo-liberalism and few have recovered from it. Now is this new economic crisis was in large part brought about because of a neo-liberal proxy war causing oil shortages and other supply line issues. 

What's gonna happen now is the economy will re-stabilise and the PM who stabilises it will be crowned a 'hero' by the press, as the tory Cameron was and just as Truss has been denounced as a villain. Now this 'hero' might be Sunak, it might Starmer. Both of them are neo-liberals. Both of them favour big buisness and the ruling elites over us the unwashed masses. The economic recovery will not in fact improve things for the majority of us. For many of us, in fact, things will stay bad or get worse. But we'll be told to celebrate as the ruling class see record profits, though we'll not see a penny. 

What is the point of this then? What is the solution here? The solution is to stop supporting the neo-liberal parties of the ruling class - Conservative, Liberal Democrat, and yes, Labour and to start organising along class lines. It's time to join unions and forming workers councils. It's time to create women workers groups, queer workers groups and black/brown workers groups. It's time to start organising along class lines in opposition to ruling class politics. It's time to start governing ourselves and our own economy, and take power away from the ruling classes. 

This has been accomplished many times before in many countries. Their efforts were eroded by, you guessed it, neo-liberalism. Like I said, neo-liberalism was a reaction against all this, against meagre social reforms made in response to workers getting organised, against the true labour movement in this country and many others. We cannot allow the neo-liberals ultimate victory.

So don't fall for this Liz Truss distraction. Don't fall for whatever individual they raise as a hero or villain next. There is an entire class of people at fault here, a ruling class that controls too much of our infrastructure, food production, industrial production and pretty much every other facet of our lives. There is not one enemy, there is an entire class of enemies.",455334592069910372,0

8218,ybevqt,I don't know who I want to win the leadership election,"Well, obviously, I don't want any of them as prime minister. But who would you choose, and why?

Here's the options:

Rishi Sunak (lawful evil): He's being pushed as the ""sensible"" option; a technocrat with a reputation as a competent administrator who is the best placed to return the markets to some kind of sanity. He's also a classic Thatcherite, possibly the richest man to ever sit in parliament, was charged in the Partygate affair and his wife has been involved in tax evasion. 

On the one hand, if he presents the best option of us all being able to afford our heating and mortgages this winter, that would be nice. On the other hand, he might be the most capable at destroying anything that remains of the welfare state and environmental protections.

Reelection: will try to run out the clock. He's unpopular with Tory members and many MPs on account of his betrayal of Johnson (and maybe his ethnicity). The right-wing media are gearing up to support him and hope to turn things around in the next two years.

Boris Johnson (chaotic evil): A complete moral vacuum with no guiding principles other than a lust for power and status. He is responsible for many thousands of deaths and the severe degradation of the political, structural, social and economic situation in this country. His many disasters in office - of which no-one needs further reminders - should disqualify him from ever being near any sort of position of responsibility ever again. All evidence shows that he is thoroughly ill-equipped to deal with any of the current omnicrises. However...

If he wins the leadership again, significant parts of the Tory parliamentary party will rebel. Many may quit altogether. He will be faced with a disintegrating party he will be unable to control. He may be forced to an early election where (hopefully) the Conservative party is comprehensively trounced. He may be the tool (in more than one sense) that destroys the Tory party, maybe even for good. In which case, Boris for PM?

Reelection: He still enjoys some support from the party's grassroots who think he is a funny man that Got Brexit Done. He is nevertheless rightly loathed by many, including many former voters in places like the ""red wall"". His notorious charisma might help to redeem him to some extent, but I really hope the British people have seen through that act by now.

Penny Mordaunt (neutral evil): She is trying to bill her lack of high level governmental experience as an opportunity to be a clean start, without the baggage of Johnson and Sunak. She has no obvious principles other than a desire to reunite the party, hold on to power and not to be threatening. 

She may present the party another opportunity to evolute once again into a fresh new administration, totally unlike the previous administrations (apart from having exactly the same cretins in government). Maybe she'd be able to keep some of the crazies away from the levers of power? Maybe not. I have no idea, and it seems nobody else does either.

Reelection: Who knows? If she can reunite and rebuild the party, anything is possible. But it seems unlikely.

Turns out that Truss' support for fracking isn't what we thought.   
What she meant was all about fracturing the Conservative party to smithereens.   
A quick look back over the last twenty years show frack after frack, with the schism Cameron thought he would backfill with the referendum, but which rippled like an earthquake through the party instead. There was no oil, just flying shards and big parts of the UK falling into the sea. The White Cliffs of Farage roiled the English Channel. Toxic gas in the form of Fabricante and Dorries escaped through the cracks. And some say monsters have been awakened from their slumber.

Some Tory grandees are pleading for an end to the fracking. Calls for unity are getting ever more desperate. But the membership is having none of it. They have a death wish, and keep choosing the worst of the bunch. 

So now, some MPs are requesting a change in the selection rules, to keep the membership out of it. But most telling, and most damning of all, is that the leadership are beginning to tell the membership that the voting will continue until they get it right. This could be the greatest frack of all, with the Party casting the membership aside, daring them to form splinter parties, and sending them frothing into the night.",-4702112793945347185,0

8225,yar5ts,"If Johnson proves himself untouchable by returning to power, how do you think the Tories will sabotage democracy to remain in power in 2024?","Because we are far past simple trickery at this point. Casual gerrymandering is too soft for them. Now they're proving they can be completely unchallenged and unaccountable, they can stop pretending. Truss seems to have been legitimately planned to make us want Johnson back. They have made it clear they plan to ignore any attempt at an early GE. What do you predict they'll do to sabotage the next GE in their favour?

While Starmer continues to obey the Tories and drive Labour further and further to the right to ensure there is no real opposition, and to ensure nobody else gets any airtime in the news, I'm guessing we'll see further vilification of 'the Left' and probably some persecution on made-up charges of hate speech. Protest laws will get stricter and stricter until non-Tory political rallies are caught up in them and broken up by police. There will be no alternative.

I'm starting to think that this is legitimately how Nineteen Eighty-Four actually began:

>The Party exists to keep itself in power. ... If you want a vision of the future, Winston, imagine a boot, stamping on a human face, forever.

8249,yaybpg,Does anyone else feel slightly disappointed with Ash Sarkar for going on Piers Morgan Uncensored so much?," Firstly, I just want to say how much I appreciate Ash and how great she is at speaking truth to power. In the past she's generated great viral clips of her making Piers Morgan look like a complete idiot on Good  Morning Britain which are great for the cause. I'm never going to begrudge her going onto GMB with their massive audience of millions of the British public and schooling the local flag nonces and introducing others to well-articulated socialist ideals. 

 But given that Piers Morgan Unwatched has an audience of a mere 25,000 per episode, she's not reaching a significant number of people and actually she's straying into the territory of just taking the Murdoch bucks. They need her more than she needs them at this point. Her presence legitimises Piers Morgan's show and she seems to be going on with concerning regularity. They've got so desperate that appearance fees are apparently around the £10,000 mark, but at what point are you just mugging off Rupert Murdoch's failing channel and taking their money? And when are you basically becoming one of their regular commentators and enriching yourself from the evil lizard's purse and legitimising their hate channel?

Just for those unfamiliar, this is not anything like Good Morning Britain - Piers Morgan Unwatched platforms vicious transphobes like [Kellie Jay Kean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yH-AMeS9230) and [Matt Walsh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PD9a8q-LW3w), as well as  domestic abusing misogynists like [Andrew Tate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFqcb07VJz4). She literally appeared on an [episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5fcnnljtya) this week that started with Piers Morgan platforming Kanye West. 

Would be really interested to hear what everybody thinks - Ash and Novara have done great things for the cause (you can probably see from my post history I'm a big fan of their work), but I'm just a bit  disappointed right now and not sure how to think. I respect her but I think she maybe needs to stop. Ash Sarkar has a much bigger platform already than some fringe TV show that has 1/3 of the viewers of GB News.",-1753768695663497744,0

Bare with me, this isn’t an ad to express the diversity and inclusion of the Tory party, on the contrary, it’s an example of the blatant corruption.

To put this into perspective, they even have a members section for “international members”, and after doing some digging, they too are still entitled to vote for the leadership of the Tory party, ie, essentially voting for our next prime minister.

This essentially means, there’s a fucking huge gaping hole in our political system that doesn’t just allow international manipulation, but quite literally encourages it.

There should probably be an inquest into how many of the members are 1. Fake profiles, 2. From a controversial country, 3. How many that have voted previously from abroad for the leadership are not actually eligible to vote in the UK.

TLDR : conservatives are corrupt scum

8335,y9sc4o,Does Britain deserve the mess its in?,"We all know the deep shit this country is currently in, but I keep asking myself if collectively we deserve it? Where do we even start?

We have become a nation of complainers for the most part, everybody acknowledges how fucked normal people are, but so few people are actually prepared to act and do something about it. We mock the French, but look at them, out in the streets in droves, protesting about what's being heaped upon them. What would it actually take in the UK to shake people out of this apathy and protest on mass? We're already being pushed into further and further poverty by those in power, we can't afford to feed our children or heat our homes, but we just moan and carry on with this absurd British stuff upper lip better not rock the boat mentality. 

Any normal working person with a brain stem can see that no matter who the leader, the Tory party is rotten to the core, full of corrupt, self serving bastards who don't give a shit about those they are elected to serve. So why do those same people keep voting for them? I understand the lack of viable alternatives, but for gods sake you have to try, right? Surely anybody at this point is better? 

As I'm writing this there are thousands, maybe even millions of people looking forward to a PM previously deemed incapable to rule, coming back. A man who has the blood of 200k people on his hands. Who lies through this teeth. Who partied with his mates whilst telling the rest of us not to see loved ones, even if they were dying and it was the last time we may ever see them. A man who covered up a sexual assault by a member of his party then once again liee about it. But I've spoken to people who still defend this man. Its unbelievable. 

A big issue surely must be the mainstream media, being run by friends of the Tories. Basically telling people what they should think and do, and who to vote for, and smearing those who may threaten the establishment. But the other side of this must surely be that we as a nation have lost our ability to think critically for ourselves, instead we must be some of the most easily manipulated nations on Earth? 

There are plenty of individuals out there with a genuine desire to make change happen, but I feel as though those of us who do are being undermined by those who are just so set in their ways. Take these Poundland Tories for example, who somehow think voting Tory will somehow make them not working class any more, why? There is something fundamentally wrong with this country now, I'll wager a great many people still like the idea of being ruled by an elite gentry and could gladly step aside and tip their caps whilst bowing their heads as they ride past? 

Sorry for the rant, it's just so frustrating to see whats being done to so many families and knowing that collectively we have the power to change things, it just seems as though all we will ever do is moan and do nothing? I read a story about children in schools eating rubbers because they are so hungry and their parents cannot afford to feed them. Others hide in the playground during lunch time out of shame because they don't have food to eat. As a parent, living in a supposedly developed country, that breaks my heart and boils my blood in equal measure that such things can be allowed to happen in a country with such wealth. That alone should be enough for people to hit the streets in our millions, but again, its not happening.

Again sorry for the rant, and I'm sorry in advance if me thinking out loud offends anyone, thats not my intention. I just needed to vent.",-4615777484754136774,0
8336,y9oy2j,When it all shakes out I think it’ll be Penny Mordaunt,"I post this purely because it’ll be fun to kick around, and I got botbanned from r/UnitedKingdom for “activity in groups that often brigade the subreddit”, which I guess was you guys, IDK. So purely out of a bit of morbid entertainment, I thought I’d see how my thoughts go over here. 

I went through my social media and I was quite pleased with myself that I was saying “Liz Truss Next” as early as April. I don’t flatter myself to be a genius of political analysis, it was just a punt for a bit of fun; but encouraged by that I’m rolling my metaphorical winnings into an accumulator and saying it’ll be Penny Mordaunt for our next PM.

Why?
You might have seen a few of these interviews with furious old-school tories about “talentless nobodies in charge” etc… the more centrist wing is furious about how the insurgent populist right have absolutely destroyed the credibility of their party. These guys will not settle down behind anyone from any point from Boris rightwards. 

The ERG ghouls like Jacob Rees Mogg likewise are utterly tainted, everyone knew they were the puppet masters of this farce. They won’t go away, but they are going to have to hide from the light in cool darkness of their crypt for a few years and make do practicing darker and more subtle arts.

I’d toy with Rishi getting a buyers remorse bounce, but he can’t stand now in the same way a prizefighter can’t take another shot at the title a week after a loss. He was bruised politically by the campaign against him, and those are still too fresh for him to stand tall again.

So what, dust off some old buffer like Ken Clark? Most of the fossils from John Major’s time are now to the left of Kieth Starmer on many issues; in the same way the dusty old school will no longer sit behind a hard right ideologue, there’s no way the epic lib-triggering culture warriors are going to line up behind a relic who’s not even of twitter.

Then there’s Penny. Orbited around the politics of Boris, but never stepped too far into the inflammatory Guardian-baiting sauce. A nice establishment veneer from her naval connections. Appealingly dull, all the old wannabe Francis Urquart’s of the undead realms will think her nicely pliable to a little blood hypnosis (on which point honestly I think they’d get a nasty surprise). Sober, conciliatory, and agreeable to nearly all. Will probably throw enough immigrant flesh at the likes of Braverman to keep them sated, but won’t actually dance on the starved babies of sanctioned Universal Credit claimants.

I’d prefer it wasn’t. I’m very eager to see the tories tear themselves apart. But the country can’t afford more chaos, and the Conservative party have an instinct for solidarity that puts your militant trade Union to shame. They’ll pull for their team for a while, but when enough of them see it’s Mordaunt or the end of the party they will line up.

Committee members are expected to recap their findings, and delve into Trump's ""state of mind"" as well as the critical role he played in inciting the insurrection. Members have promised to present ""surprising"" new details as well as ""a great deal of new documentary evidence"".

This includes newly obtained Secret Service records and surveillance video footage, which are said to corroborate the Committee's key findings and validate the most dramatic insider testimonies from previous hearings.

However, there will be no live witness testimony this time.
